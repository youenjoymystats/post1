
Leigh Fordham sold me out
46 days and the coal ran out
Please come round here another day
Sit yourself down when you're ready to stay

She dug down when they took the town
Lookin' for clues but they couldn't be found
Leigh found out she was ready to roam
47 days and the coal came home

Taste the fear 
For the devil's drawing near

They're tyin' a blindfold cross my eyes
I rest my face down
Skidding on switchbacks near the sides
Gonna try to bust out

Get up, jump out, don't wait, gotta get away
Hop off, roll down, spring up, live another day

Sprint on cobblestones past the tracks
They kept my money, and my water
Dont wanna run cuz I want it back
But I know I really ought to

If I don't break away clean
I might stray from the scene
Make an escape when it arrives:
The 555        

They bought my soul for a pile of cash
Everybody else got paid out
They're closing in I gotta dash
I gotta find a way out

Hop off, roll down, spring up, live another day
Get up, jump out, don't wait

If I don't break away clean
I might stray from the scene
Make an escape when it arrives:
The 555

A song I heard the ocean sing
A shining light in darkness deep
I prayed a prayer into the tide
And both they soothed me in my sleep

For every season that has passed
I prayed a prayer into the tide
A shining light in darkness deep
In my ten years before the mast

For every season that has passed
I laid my body oer the side
A shining light in darkness deep
I prayed a prayer into the tide

How can I answer questions Ive known?

A song I heard the ocean sing
A shining light in darkness deep
Ten years before the mast
I heard the ocean sing

Mr. Palmer is concerned with the thousand dollar question
Just like Roger, he's a crazy little kid
I've got the time, if you've got the inclination
So cheer up Palmer, you'll soon be dead

The noose is hanging, at least you won't die wondering
Sit up and take notice, tell like it is
If I were near you, I wouldn't be far from you
I've got a feeling, you know what you did

AC/DC Bag
AC/DC Bag

Time to put your money where your mouth is
Put 'em in a field and let 'em fight it out
I'm running so fast my feet don't touch the ground
I'm a stranger here, I'm going down

Let's get down to the nitty gritty
Let's get this show on the road
I'll show you mine if you show me yours
I'm breathing hard open the door

AC/DC Bag

Brain dead and made of money
No future at all
Pull down the blinds and run for cover
No future at all

Who would've thought it, that's where I am
No future at all
Don't sweat it, that's where I am
Oh, carry me down

The first time I came over I was bitten by your dog
You werent even there cause you were walking in the fog
I call you up and plead and beg and talk to your machine
My friends say not to bother when youre acting pretty mean

But I dont need to bother you, no I wont play that part
I just want access to the inside of your heart
Access to your thoughts on the way that I should be
So I could start to change and maybe you could access me
Access me

You could tell me all about all the things you did at work
The guy who sits beside you and how hes acting like a jerk
And you dont have to open up the secrets of your soul
But if thats the place you want me Id be glad to pay the toll

There is a place on the mountain nearby
Deep in a cave 
but it's up rather high
There in the darkness are safely concealed
All of the dreams 
that you never revealed

And if you go there
and after you do
All of these dreams 
would be yours to pursue
The rest of your lifetime 
devoid of a care
If you keep your eyes open 
you may find yourself there

Such is the promise
such is the curse
You could just live your life 
better or worse
Knowing the cache of dreams 
up on that hill
Beckons and sways 
but won't bend to your will

You might find a river 
under a mountain
That feeds a remote subterranean fountain

Drink from this taste 
just a hint of a dream
That somehow leaked into 
the underground stream

Woke up this morning 
And I had those Walking Blues
Woke up this morning 
And I had those Walking Blues
I wasn't walkin' nowhere 'cause I didn't have no legs!

Well I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright now (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright now (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
'cause I got a degree!

Staring over the edge of the bed
My old lady turned to me and she started to cry
Staring over the edge of the bed
My old lady turned to me and she started to cry
She said "I'm gonna take this diploma,
I'm gonna slice you in the eye!"

Well I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright now (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright now (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
'cause I got a degree!

[Additional Lyrics]

Escaping through my window
There's a policeman on the lawn outside my home
Escaping through my window
There's a policeman on the lawn outside my home
I opened my mouth to scream but my throat was full of foam

So I'm sittin' in this cell
My fortune dwindled to a thimble full of filth
So I'm sittin' in this cell
My fortune dwindled to a thimble full of filth
I may spend the rest of my life in jail but at least it's got a floor!

Well I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright now (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright now (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
I'm alright (he's alright)
'cause I got a degree!

They're hammering nails in the coffin of fun
The last drop of warmth from your soul has been wrung
You now have to face that the  day has begun
 
It means you'll be summoned to a place they call work
In whose hallways you linger and corners you lurk
You're already three days late on a task
That they gave you to fail, they don't even ask
 
Jack and Jill went up the hill
to fetch a pail of water
Jack fell down and broke his crown 
and Jill came tumbling after
amidst the peals of laughter

Your brain is in pain and your fate has been sealed
The liquid inside of your eyes has congealed
You can't see in color or discern friend from foe
Your neighbors wake slowly and glare 'cause they know
 
That you don't fit in, you can't earn their trust
You're up at all hours "you're not one of us"
They scowl at your windows but smile at the sun
The world has awakened, the day has begun
 
Against my will drawn up the hill
amidst the peals of laughter
in pain I'm chained to the end of the train
where I remain thereafter
amidst the peals of laughter...

Loose the caboose I'm calling a truce

Anarchy! 
Anarchy! 
Anarchy! 
Anarchy!

I am just a satellite
high above the atmosphere
Bouncing every thing you say
to someone who is meant to hear
Sometimes on a rainy day
I lie in bed and dream of you
So blame it on the satellite
when your message can't get through

I am just a tiny wave
a minor ripple out at sea
Moving slowly towards the shore
burdened with uncertainty
I'm gaining power
losing speed
wondering as I near your door
Will you hold it open 
for the tidal wave approaching shore?

You've become an island 
in the hazy world surrounding me
Offering a vast reward 
each time I safely cross the sea
All too often I become lost 
in the fog and haze
Clinging still
against my will
to promises of clearer days

I am just a raindrop 
that accelerates without control
Losing bits and pieces in descent 
'til I'm no longer whole
I am just another shooting star 
above that you might see
Until I have your full attention 
I'll be anything but me

All these worlds
Rolled into one
Together we revolve around the sun
And if you get the chance
Watch the young children dance
In a little while, you will see them smile.

Truth may dazzle
Gradually
It all comes out in the wash eventually
Try to catch a glean
If you know what I mean.
You may even see the cogs in the machine

Reconvene, reconnect
Raise a glass to the Architect
Cause it turned out better
So much better
Than we ever did expect

Find your treasures
Where you will
Dont you stop until youve had your fill
Wherever you may go
Look around, take it slow
There might be more to this than we all know

And if we have the chance to see the rough draft
I bet the early plans would make us laugh
And it never seems to help when we try to intervene
Some things are better left unseen

Reconvene, reconnect
Raise a glass to the Architect
Cause it turned out better
So much better
Than we ever did expect

Northern dilemma
Call of the cold
The arms of the arctic
Begin to unfold

Sit in a circle facing the sun
Get what you can now
Winter is on

Truth on condition
Never dig deep
Solemn reminders as groundwaters seep
Into foundations, centers of joy
To weaken and crumble
Search and destroy

Light up the city
Hiding so strange
Youd better take cover
Its love at close range

Oh solo mission
Cover of dark
Army of one now, dont let down your guard

Sit in a circle facing the sun
Soak it in while you can
Winter is on
I got no answer but youve got no call
Just cant compete with the weight of it all

Silent treatment
Stone in the rain
Bright, shining doorway
Try to remain

Northern dilemma
Call of the cold
The arms of the arctic begin to unfold


I dropped the buzzard in the sand and strode off slowly toward the town
I needed dinner and a place where I could throw my weight around
I detected faint axilla scent that put me off my appetite
But mouflon warring where I went renewed in me a need to fight

Then reveling in mirror mask I soon was lost in foggy ditch
Without a feather gray or white to tickle that piano witch
Fearing that I must expose my worm to holographic haze
My Clinometer error rose and spawned in her new mawkish ways

I woke the witch with reverence reserved for serpents, snails, and slugs
I pulled the witch from out the ditch and turned to face the furry thugs
The sheep they smiled with teeth agleam
The weapons in their hooves revolved I detected a prostatic ream
I gulped and felt my loins dissolve!!!

Axilla
Axilla
Axilla
Axilla
Axilla
Axilla


Summer sitting out by the pool
A ray of sunshine getting in my way
Close your eyes and wish that it were cool
Everyday

And I wish it could be back the other way
But what's dissolved ain't coming back today
Close your eyes and wish that it were
Close your eyes and wish that it were

Axilla 
Axilla 
Axilla 
Axilla

Never understood what my body was for
That's why I always leave it layin' out on the floor
The shape of curiosity
Where different faces fit before

Tracing my image in the sand
To pass the time from slip to fall
The line I trace begins to weave
A tangled web from wall to wall 

Axilla 
Axilla 
Axilla 
Axilla
Axilla
Axilla

When I jumped off I had a bucket full of thoughts
When I first jumped off I held that bucket in my hand
Ideas that would take me all around the world
I stood and watched the smoke behind the mountain curl
It took me a long time to get back on the train

Now I'm gone and I'll never look back again
I'm gone and I'll never look back at all
You know I'll never look back again
I turn my face into the howling wind
It took me a long time to get back on the train

See my face in the town that's flashing by
See me standing in the station in the rain
See me running there beside the car
I left it all behind me and I've traveled far
It took me a long time to get back on the train

Happy happy oh my friend
Blow out candles once again
Leave the presents all inside
Take my hand
And lets take a ride
Backwards down the number line
You were eight and I was nine
Do you know what happened then?

Do you know why were still friends?
Laughing all these many years
We pushed through hardships tasted tears
Made a promise one to keep
I can still recite it in my sleep
Every time a birthday comes
Call your friend and sing a song
Or whisper it into his ear
Or write it down
Just dont miss a year

You decide what it contains
How long it goes but this remains
The only rule is it begins
Happy happy oh my friend

You decide what it contains
How long it goes but this remains
The only rule is it begins
Happy happy oh my friend

All my friends
Come backwards down the number line

And when I see you coming down the line
With eyes wide open
Somewhere in between the past and future
Where you drift in time
And you can see a different point of view

Brett is in the bathtub
making soup for the ambassadors
and I am in the hallway
singing to the troubadours

The kings are all lined up
outside the gate
and the autumn bells are ringing
but they'll just have to wait

Where is the joker?
Have you seen him around
with his three coned cap
that he wears like a crown

Have you seen his stripped stockings
and heard his sad tale
about the kids under the carpet
and the purple humpbacked whales

Here come the ambassadors
they show up one by one
Brett is tasting all the soup
to see if it is done

Wendy's on the windowsill
waiting to be let in
and we're all in the bathtub now
making bathtub gin

The kings storm the hallway
they've climbed up through the gate
they didn't mean to be impolite
but they just couldn't wait

Here comes the joker
with his silly grin
he carries a martini
made of bathtub gin

Here comes the joker
we all must laugh
cause we're all in this together
and we love to take a bath.

A sad refrain as tears depart
A word remains that I can start
To map the borders of my heart
And change the channels that I chart

Im not complete but feel the heat
As pavement seals me to the street
Immobilized I realized 
Misjudged the situations size

Though seasons change and seeds may start
The beauty of a broken heart
Cannot be seen but in full view 
The colors can come back to you

A love supreme, an ancient art
A finely tuned piano part
That plays its notes from stop to start
And hinges on a broken heart

Though seasons change and seeds may start
The beauty of a broken heart
Cannot be seen but in full view 
The colors can come back to you

Effortlessly gliding down the spiral headed toward the ground
Of radiance arriving much too soon
Humbly acknowledging the thoughts inside increase my slide
The grade is what propels me to my room

Though seasons change and seeds may start
The beauty of a broken heart
Cannot be seen but in full view 
The colors can come back to you

When I get home from work, what do I do?
I try to kill you
When I get home from work, what do I do?
I try to kill you

And why would I try to kill you?

Because you're a
Big black furry creature from Mars
Big black furry creature from Mars
Big black furry creature from Mars
Big black furry creature from Mars

When we go out to eat, what do I do?
I try to kill you
When we go out to eat, what do I do?
Oh, I am killing you

Now why would I go and do that?

Because you're a
Big black furry creature from Mars
Big black furry creature from Mars
Big black furry creature from Mars
Big black furry creature from Mars

I'm runnin', I'm runnin' from you
I'm runnin', I'm runnin'

And what causes me to run?

'Cause you're a
Big black furry creature from Mars
Big black furry creature from Mars
Big black furry creature from Mars
Big black furry creature from Mars

Big black furry creature from Mars
Big black furry creature from Mars
Big black furry creature from Mars
Big black furry creature from Mars

Big black furry creature from Mars
Big black furry creature from Mars
Big black furry creature from Mars
Big black furry creature from Mars

Tumbling greens
A pickup screams
Alone above the square
Oh sing softly

Above the trees
Where Billy breathes
We float upon the air

Softly sing sweet songs

Silent scenes
In motion means
Ill wake you when were there
Oh sing softly

Time, it seems
In broken dreams
To sleep beside the stair

It's easy sometimes when you just coast along
But like it or not something always seems to go wrong
Sometimes people build you up just so they can knock you down
Sometimes they will have you there 'cause they need someone around

Perhaps you'll receive invitations for tea
or perhaps you will laugh and you will make them all smile
Or maybe you'll join them 'cause it had to be
Perhaps you'll forget you forgot for a while

Birds of a feather are flocking outside
like whippets they dance in a curly-queue dance
of pulses and ringing and campfire chants
of ritual drumming although at first glance
you thought you could run but you won't take a chance

it's not an experience if they can't bring someone along
they hang on emotions they bottle inside
they peck at the ground 
and they strut out of stride

Gina knows what it's like to be 
on the other side of midnight
Gina's eyes are sensitive
to the brighter side of daylight
She knows what it's like to be
the topic of conversation
While birthday boys are wallowing 
in acres of adulation
I don't mind
if you stand around and look at me tonight
I'd quite like it
Kinds like us are blind
to the dirt that gathers in between the toes of moderation

Gina knows

You can come around but don't you talk to me
I'm not in the mood for conversation
You can come around but don't you talk to me

I don't mind
if you come around and drink up all my wine
Won't be the first time
Sometimes I find
little treasures hidden deep within my drawers
Gina knows

You can come around but don't you talk to me
I'm not in the mood for conversation
You can come around but don't you talk to me

When the only tool you have is a hammer
Everything looks like a nail
And your living at the Bittersweet Motel

When the only tool you have is a hammer
Everything looks like a nail
And your living at the Bittersweet Motel

Halfway between Erie and Pittsburgh
You're putting me through hell
On the highway to the Bittersweet Motel

Halfway between Erie and Pittsburgh
You're putting me through hell
On the highway to the Bittersweet Motel

When the only tool you have is a hammer
Everything looks like a nail
And your living at the Bittersweet Motel


The woman was a dream I had
Though rather hard to keep
for when my eyes were watching hers
They closed,
And I was still asleep.

For when my hand was holding hers
She whispered words and I awoke
And faintly bouncing around the room
The echo of whomever spoke
I awoke and faintly bouncing round the room
the echo of whomever spoke.

The place I sought was far beneath
The surface of the sea
My sight was poor
But I was sure
The sirens sang their songs for me
They dance above me as I sink
I see them through a crystal haze
And hear them bouncing round the room
the never ending coral maze


If youre just staring at your walls
Observing echoing footfalls
From tenants wandering distant halls
Than this one is for you

If children playing all around
To you is noise not pleasant sound
And youd be lost on the playground
Then this one is for you

All alone the life you lead
A silent diner where you feed
You bow your head pretend to read
this one if for you

Slip past strangers in the street
Theres no one that you care to meet
Longing for your TV seat
this one is for you

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Somebody's jumping in the tub with your brother
Somebody's jumping in the tub with your brother

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Somebody's jumping in the tub with your brother
Somebody's jumping in the tub with your brother

Jumping in the tub with your cousin!
Somebody's definitely jumping in the tub with your brother
Uncle!

Somebody's jumping in the tub with your brother!
Somebody's jumping in the tub with your mother!

Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

"Looking for owls?" 
The young man asked
Hoping to lighten the tension
And the scowl he received 
as his only reply
Made him smile 
as he relived the mention

And the coward fool 
walked on alone
Quite proud of the fear he instilled
And later they found him
tied to a log
Bent over and buffalo billed

there've been times when I wonder
and times when I don't
concepts I'll ponder
and concepts I won't ever see

god isn't one of these
former or latter
which did you think I meant?
it doesn't matter to me

bug  don't need it
bug  don't feed it
my thoughts faded
it doesn't matter/overrated

cold in my hand
in a country pool
standing and waving
the rain, wind on the runway

spending or saving
credit or debt
which did you think I meant?
nothing I see can be taken from me

bug  don't need it
bug  don't feed it
my thoughts faded
it doesn't matter/overrated

Trouble seems to follow me
Like a thoughtless lonely dog
I can't shake it no matter how I run
And you know and I don't
I seen it coming from the sun
There will be lots to say
And hell to pay
Before this day gets done

But I'll bridge when I get to it
Find a fire I can set to it
There's trouble coming but the spark is lit
And I'll burn that bridge when I get to it

Sunlight in your smile
Seen it twinkling through
I've been on this earth awhile
I've never met no one like you.
But Lord knows I'm a sinner
But something tells me you are too
And I'll pay tomorrow for what I pray
We're about to do

But I'll bridge when I get to it
Find a fire I can set to it
The trouble's coming but the spark is lit
And I'll burn that bridge when I get to it

Sometimes you got to break the rules
And throw away the book
Touch the candle at both ends
And leave before you look

I may be a little crazy
And lord knows I'm no great catch
But you survive the gasoline
And I'll survive a match

But I'll bridge when I get to it
I know I shouldn't but the spark is lit
If this is trouble, I don't mind a bit
And I'll burn that bridge when I get to it

Burn that bridge when I get to it
Find a fire I can set to it
The trouble's coming but the spark is lit
And I'll burn that bridge when I get to it

Burn that bridge x8
Burn burn burn that bridge  x2

Where I end
and you begin
I wanna find... that line
and cross it back and forth 
until it's erased 
by our foot steps
by our foot steps
by our foot steps

One small step
I saw you take
along the tube
toward the glow

Words I formed 
to call you back
You paused and spoke
soft and low

Can't come back
Can't come back
I can't come back, come back

I thought I saw 
you in your chair
a shadow bent 
like you were there
I asked the dark 
what would you think
of coming back 
to join me

Can't come back
Can't come back
I can't come back, come back

Can't go back
Can't go back
I can't go back, go back

I saw you with Carini and that piece of ass
You built your house with windows 
but those windows had no glass
Lucy had a lumpy head
Lucy took a walk, now Lucy's dead

[Alternate first verse:
I saw you with Carini and that naked dude
I couldn't eat my food
Lucy had a lumpy head
Lucy took a walk, now Lucy's dead]

You told me of a secret place
I saw it when I met you
the walrus on your face
Aghilla scared the shit out of the ram

The thesis that you're writing is a load of shit
But I'm glad you finally finished it
You went across the street and he called his dad
Now you'll never get the raise you thought you had

The people all were screaming when they saw the lump
Everyone was screaming when they saw the lump
Aghilla scared the shit out of the ram

Carini had a lumpy head
Carini had a lumpy head
Carini had a lumpy head
Carini had a lumpy head

I'd catapult downtown
To see the galleries
And my favorite fiancee
In a lavender gown

But I'm hooked up to a machine
It performs my daily functions
Through a tube in my wien

And today that thing malfunctioned
Like a forest fire
It burnt a hole in me and I perspired

So there ain't gonna be a wedding
No love affair
No art to which none compares

Your time is near, the mission's clear
It's later than we think
Before you slip into the night
You'll want something to drink
Steal away before the dawn, and
Bring us back good news
But if you've tread in primal soup
Please wipe it from your shoes

Just then a porthole pirate
Scourged the evening with his cry
And sanctuary bugs deprived
The monkey of its thigh
A dust arose and clogged my nose
Before I could blink twice
Despite the stuff that bubbled up
I gave some last advice:

The flesh from Satan's dogs
Will make the rudiments of gruel

Deduct the carrots from your pay
You worthless swampy fool

Exploding then through fields and fen
And swimming in the mire
The septic maiden's gargoyle tooth
Demented me with fire
I drifted where the current chose
Afloat upon my back
And if perchance a newt slimed by
I'd stuff it in my sack

Soon I felt a bubble form, Somewhere below my skin
But with handy spine of hedgehog
I removed the force within
Suzie then removed her mask
And caused a mighty stir
The angry mob responded
Taking turns at grabbing her

The foggy cavern's musty grime
Appeared within my palm

I snatched Rick's fork to scrape it off
With deadly icy calm

The crowd meanwhile had taken Sue
And used her like a rag
To mop the slime from where the slug
Had slithered with the bag

In summing up, the moral seems
A little bit obscure...

Give the director a serpent deflector
a mudrat detector, a ribbon reflector
a cushion convector, a picture of nectar
a virile dissector,a hormone collector

Whatever you do take care of your shoes

Come stumble my mirth beaten worker
Im Jezmund the family berzerker
Im bought for the price of a flagon of rice
The wind buffs the cabin
You speak of your life
Or more willingly Locust the Lurker

Confuse what you can of the ending
And revise your despise so impending
Cause I soak on the wrath
That you didnt quite mask
Im getting it clearly through alternate paths
Or mixed in with the signal youre sending

But who can unlearn all the facts that Ive learned
As I sat in their chairs and my synapses burned
And the torture of chalk dust collects on my tongue
Thoughts follow my vision and dance in the sun
All my vasoconstrictors they come slowly undone
Cant this wait til Im old
Cant I live while Im young?

But no peace for Jezmund tonight
I plug the distress tube up tight
And watch what I say as it flutters away
And all this emotion is kept harmless at bay
Not to educate somebodys fright

I was taught a month ago
to bide my time and take it slow
then I learned just yesterday
to rush and never waste the day

I'm convinced the whole day long
that all I learn is always wrong
and things are true that I forget
but no one taught that to me yet

I ought to see the man Mulcahy

Colonel Forbin stared up at the mountain
And wiped away the beads of sweat
That glistened on his brow
His tired feet were buried in the quagmire
And his bloodshot eyes saw all that lay between him
And fulfillment of his vow

And he felt his fingers wrap around a knotted root
And pulled his body upwards
To a sea green mossy boulder
And he dragged his weary shit-ass [or "carcass"] up the mountain

And he climbed so slowly
He climbed so slowly
Ahead
Ahead

Suddenly he heard the crack of thunder
And the rocks began to crumble overhead
And tumble down the mountain to the
Dismal swamp that lay beneath the jagged cliffs
Through which his path had led
And the earth began to quake beneath his feet
And the mighty mountain changed before his eyes
And he stood amidst a sea of dust and rocks and stones
Cascading down the mountain
And a thousand birds were headed for the sky. Oh...

The sacred creed will be yours
And if you wait until tomorrow
The sacred creed will be yours
To devour
Yours
To seize
And to obey
Obey

When the dust had cleared, the colonel lifted up his head
And was driven to his knees by a blazing beam of light
And he saw the silhouette that stood before him
And he bowed in reverence
Trembling in the shadow of the mighty legend's form
Icculus the prophet stood before his eyes
Looking down on Colonel Forbin
Where he shuddered in the puddles and the muck
And he quietly addressed him

And he spoke so slowly
He spoke so slowly
Ahead
He said

Colonel Forbin I know why you've come here
And I'll help you with your quest to gain the knowledge that you lack
I call upon my faithful friend the mockingbird
To fly and seize the helping book and bring it to your shack
And a tree of knowledge in your soul will grow
And the Helping Friendly Book will plant the seed
But I warn you that all knowledge seeming innocent and pure
Becomes a deadly weapon in the hands of avarice
And greed

The sacred creed will be yours
And if you wait until tomorrow
The sacred creed will be yours
To devour
Yours
To seize
And to obey
And to obey

The tires are the things on your car
That make contact with the road
The car is the thing on the road
That takes you back to your abode

The tires are the things on your car
That make contact with the road
Bummed is what you are
When you go out to your car and it's been towed

I woke up one morning in November
And I realized I love you
It's not your headlights in front
Your tailpipe, or the skylight above you
It's the way you cling to the road
When the wind tries to shove you
I'd never go riding away
And come back home without you

She sat on her favorite couch, outside on the leaves and rocks
She was clad inside out; she could think outside the box
Never confused, she hadn't used her mind since April 1929
She drinks tea and when the tea is gone, she takes its absence as a sign

Show us how it's done
Mix up some of that bubbly potion and fly us to the sun

She learned everything incredibly fast and traveled all around the world
She went to the moon at negative speed and came back a little girl

She learned to play an electric guitar from the soul food military man
She studied hard for seven minutes flat and was the finest in the land

Show us how it's done
Mix up some of that bubbly potion and fly us to the sun

Some folks aren't good enough to be humble
(She's the only one)
The best things are the ones on which you stumble

Listen now Im talking
Ive been here for weeks
Waiting in this growing crowd 
Staring at my feet

The world around mes turning
Im just standing still
The time has come for changes
Do something or I will

Im a feather in a storm 
Im a raindrop in the sea
If I dont get enough of you
Im a lighter shade of me

Sisters, brothers all around you
Theres a devil in the crowd
Meet his eye and it's the end of time
If youre praying dont be loud

Its crowded in the lowland 
But the fools stay on the hill
You control us now 
You have the reins
Do something or we will

So show us why we came here 
Before we lay on the ground
Give it to us loud and clear
Make the devil turn around

You may as well keep your belly full
For the time may come when you'll rely on the layer of fat
That separates you from the rabid dog and the common fly
To a less demanding place on your spine
I feel you shift my weight around
I squirm and roll beneath your flesh
Just like the guy you met in town 

He's yelling at the parking lot
Throwing beer cans down the stairs
Driving home to Mom and Dad
To spend a weekend with no cares

Highway Bill's on the rotary still
and he can't even feel the pain
Of a sun dried shoulder and a scar from a boulder
that cut him right across his vein
Now he's suckin' cigar and he's shovelin' tar
in the crater of a turnpike terrain
He's got only one hope, and he wants to elope,
'cuz Highway Jill is driving him insane.

We gotta get on the road, destiny unbound
She's the one for me we gotta get outta town
We gotta get on the road, destiny unbound
She's the one for me we gotta get outta town
Highway Jill was a daffodil with a cactus sense of pride
At the wheel of a tractor, she was quite an impactor
When the road rocks started to slide
She saw Bill drop his shovel on a pile of gravel
As he climbed up out of his ditch
She was wonderstruck when he climbed in her truck
He said "I've been havin' this everlasting itch

Chorus:
At first she was cold, she was ready to scold
This guy from the pit with a thing in his head
But then she thought twice when he melted her ice
With his passionate eyes she was energized!
She started the ignition and without permission
The two of 'em flew down the dusty road
But the road wasn't finished and the pavement diminished
They soared off the edge and they plunged in the sludge

She said: There isn't even any road, our Destiny was bound
We were the ones for us but now we're in the ground(4x)

no more promises that no one could keep
no more lies to keep us from sleep
no more phone calls when you don't say what you mean
I've got faith in a fairytale, devotion to a dream

it's today the vows are broken
it's today the charade is over
it's today the curtain's coming down

now the battle-lines are chosen
it's today my eyes are open
it's today the time to turn around

no more knowing glances or places we can hide
no more chances to keep this thing alive
the two of us together it wasn't in the grand scheme
all it was was a fairytale and devotion to a dream
devotion to a dream

no more promises no more keeping score
no more wondering what I stay here for
we broke the awkward silence with polite and practiced lies
while images occupied our minds

an uneventful voyage that stranded us upstream 
all it was was a fairytale and devotion to a dream
devotion to a dream

yesterday my path was chosen
yesterday my smile was frozen
yesterday my doors were closing down

tomorrow I can cross the border
it's today a new world-order
yesterday my will was broken down

I'll ignore where this is leading
tomorrow glaciers are receding
now I'm mending things I broke inside

I'm completing thoughts unspoken
now I see that webs were woven
now I keep the windows open wide

it's today...

Let's go out to dinner and see a movie
Let's go out to dinner and see a movie
Let's go out to dinner
And see a movie
Let's go out to dinner and see a movie

I'd like to live beneath the dirt
a tiny space to move and breathe
is all that I would ever need

I wanna live beneath the dirt
where I'd be free from push and shove
like all those swarming up above

beneath their heels I'll spend my time
I'll wriggle in the earth and dew
and sometimes I will think of you

and if you ever think of me
kneel down and kiss the earth
and show me what this thought is worth

The sounds of flying swiftly, which makes it hard to find
The pathway through the darkness, every time I fall behind

I think I hear a whisper, around nearly every turn
But what the voice is saying, I barely can discern

The echoes that are following, the contours of the ground
Ebb and flow and eddies in a title wave of sound

And through the mist I think I see your face and try to learn
The meaning of expressions I barely can discern

And through the mist I think I see your face and try to learn
The meaning of expressions I barely can discern
The echoes that are following the contours of the ground
Ebb and flow and eddies in a title wave of sound

And through the mist I think I see your face and try to learn
The meaning the of expressions I barely can discern

Ahhh!
Divided sky, the wind blows high
(Divided sky, the wind blows high)
Divided sky, the wind blows high


I can't spare a moment for the dog faced boy
I won't lend another hand to theworm girl of Hanoi
Don't deplete my oxygen for the guy who's turning blue
But ask me, and I'll do anything for you

Whenever I think of you it only makes me feel sad
Whenever I think of you, the best friend I ever had...
Before I gave it up all for nothing
Well, I lied and I cheated

And it made me feel bad
It made me feel guilty for not being true
Oh the months I spend trying for a way to explain
In the end all I could do as turn my head in shame
Whenever I think of you it only makes me feel sad
Because you deserve better and once I was it
But somehow my good intentions just got up and git

Dog stole things I needed bad
Cats took what I never had
Pillows for my aching head
A glass of milk next to my bed

The creatures that seem oh so kind
Then sleep all day and ease your mind
at night they softly pad along
and look to steal things that you own

So now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord that I might keep
my soul for one more night or two
and hope the creatures never do

The creatures that seem oh so kind
Then sleep all day and ease your mind
at night they softly pad along
and look to steal things that you own

Down with disease 
Three weeks in my bed 
Trying to stop these demons that keep dancing in my head

Down with disease 
Up before the dawn
 A thousand barefoot children outside dancing on my lawn, and I keep

Waiting for the time when I can finally say 
That this has all been wonderful but now Im on my way 
But when I think its time to leave it all behind
 I try to find a way but theres nothing I can say to make it stop

Down with disease and the jungles in my mind 
Theyre climbing up my waterfalls and swingin on my vines 
So I try to hear the music but Im always losing time 
Cause theyre stepping on my rhythm and theyre stealin all my lines
 Stealin all my lines and I keep

Waiting for the time when I can finally say
 That this has all been wonderful but now Im on my way 
But when I think its time to leave it all behind
 I try to find a way but theres nothing I can say to make it stop

I sat down and talked with Dr. Gabel
Laid my cards down on the table
Broke through the lies to find another fable
I sat down and talked with Dr. Gabel

Doctor help me figure out this mess
It's hard to handle all this stress
Sometimes it's tough to make it through the day
You tell me everything will be okay

The situation's gotten out of hand
It's time to find a better action plan
I know there are some things I need to change
The problem is the world's a bit deranged

Doctor will you help me change my ways?
Will you help me glue this broken vase?
With words of wisdom valid and concise
I appreciate your fine advice
Dr. Gabel

I feel some things are out of my control
At times I've dug myself into a hole
Though  I gotta say without a doubt
You have really helped me work things out

I dug down deep to get things off my chest
It's been a struggle as you might have guessed
No need to harp on things we can't undo
Try to see it all from a brand new point of view

And even if you've fallen off your horse
Gotta get right back up again of course
There's no time for anger or for blame
It sure is nice to be back in the game

Sure is nice to be back in the game

I've been drifting, 
For years at sea. 
But now, you've come along, 
to rescue me. 

And the fog is lifted, 
We got the moon and the stars above. 

Since you came along, (love, love, love) 
I'm back where I belong. 
(love, love, love) 
Since you rescued me, 
(love, love, love) 
The whole world is there to see. 

And the storm has lifted. 
We've got the moon and stars above.. 

In Mornin' 
It's plain to see. 
Smell coffee in the air. 
You're here with me. 

I'm walkin' down the street.(love, love, love) 
The sun beams down. (love, love, love) 
The grass is cool beneath my feet. 
My head is spinnin' round and round' 

And the storm has lifted. 
We've got the moon and stars above. 

I'll tell you about the driver who lives inside my head
starts me up and stops me and puts me into bed
he opens up my mouth when it's time for me to talk
and fires up my legs when he wants me to walk

keeps my eyes open for most of the day
adds to my memories the things that people say
when he makes decisions I don't have to wait
but sometimes it seems that he's got too much on his plate

like this morning when I woke up and he dressed me in this shirt
that looks a little ragged where he dragged me through the dirt
I'm moving through this life and I'm thinking about the next
and hoping when I get there I'll be better dressed

a silent bird / a raging tide a mountainside
an open door / looming from the surf
a whispered word / a steady wind as we begin
and then no more / to close in on the earth

It was late one fall night at a fairground near town
When Esther first saw the Armenian man
Who groveled toward her and stood by her side
With a bucket that swung in his hand

His grin stretched the folds of his pasty white cheeks
And his lips hurled a dollop of murk on the curb
And the lights from the rides showed a mischievous sparkle
That flashed in his hollow eyed stare

He said "Little girl, you can chop off my legs
And then peel off my socks if you want to.
But I'd rather you took this old puppet from me
That I hold in my pail as we speak."

And he stood looking down at the innocent girl
And she stared at the bucket bewildered
Til he lifted the doll for the young girl to see
And a giant smile grew on his face
She saw the doll's eyes and she couldn't resist
And she thanked the man quickly and ran to the church
And she burst through the door with puppet held high
And a hush filled the chapel, and the people looked mean

Esther tried in vain to pacify the mob
Quibble grew to spat, to wrangle, then to brawl
The frenzied congregation struggled desperately to fetch
The pretty puppet snugly nestled deep in Esther's leather sack
Through the window of the church a storm began to rage
And Esther knew the time had come to flee

She scurried down the aisle toward the doorway in the distance
And out into the rainstorm where she felt she would be free
But the wind was blowing harder
And her skirt began to billow
Until finally her feet began to lift

And she rose above the people and the houses
and the chimneys
And Esther and the doll were set adrift
Floating higher over the hills, and the valleys and treetops
they'd flutter and glide
Soaring and turning suspended on air
With the earth far below them they'd tumble
And dive through the clouds

And she began to plummet earthward till she
Landed in the nasty part of town

She glanced about the village sure to find the evil men
Who rob and pillage in the darkest hour of night
Nervously she fumbled for the pouch that held the
Puppet on her rump.

Feeling quite outnumbered Esther hid behind
A nearby pile of lumber, where she waited
Till the dawn
Cause it would have been a blunder to
Succumb to a hoodlum on the prowl

When the morning came, she wandered through the streets
Along the chilly lake that lay beside the town
At last a peaceful moment, but she thought she heard a sound
It was an angry mob of joggers coming up to knock her down

As Esther stood and shook her head
The joggers were approaching
And she knew she had no choice left but to swim
As the frosty water sank its bitter teeth into her hide
She tried to slide the heavy clothing from her skin

Naked now she made her way toward the shore
When suddenly she felt a tiny tugging at her toe.
And the puppet she'd forgotten wrapped its tiny
Little arms around her ankle and wouldn't let her go.

The waves seemed to open and swallow her whole
As the doll pulled her down through the eerie green deep
And the sound of the laughing old man filled her ears
As she drifted away to a tranquil
And motionless sleep.


Welcome this is a farmhouse
We have cluster-flies, alas,
and this time of year is bad

We are so very sorry
There is little we can do
but swat them

She didn't beg
or not enough
She didn't stay when things got tough

I told a lie
and she got mad
She wasn't there when things got bad

I never ever saw the northern lights
I never really heard of cluster-flies
I never ever saw the stars so bright
In the farmhouse things will be all right

Woke this morning to the stinging lash
Every man rise from the ash
Each betrayal begins with trust
Every man returns to dust

I never ever saw the northern lights
I never really heard of cluster-flies
I never ever saw the stars so bright
In the farmhouse things will be all right

If time were only part of the equation
Then you could draw the boundaries of our cage
You wouldn't pile another stone upon me
And I'd be happy just to watch you age

But everything is in its own dominion
And waiting in the shallows as I do
Appeases me as water slowly trickles out
Which isn't nearly fast enough for you

It isn't nearly fast enough for you
It isn't nearly fast enough for you
Its what I was afraid of
I stumble into view
But it isn't nearly fast enough for you
It isn't nearly fast enough for you

In the cool shade of the banana tree
On the rugged trail toward the balcony
A child of the twentieth century
A dried up Goliath and a weasel named Fee

Far away in another place
A fading beauty named Milly Grace
A gospel singer with pocks on her face
And a bamboo cane to help her keep the pace

Fee was a Buddhist prodigy
Long past the age of maturity
Someday he knew it would set him free
Like it did for Floyd the chimpanzee

Oh, Fee, you're trying to live a life
That's completely free.
You're racing with the wind
You're flirting with death
So have a cup of coffee
And catch your breath

Fee first met Milly in a bar in Peru
His heart was jumping like a kangaroo
Like a beast in a cage in an old Dutch zoo
It was hopping and thumping in wooden shoes

But Floyd was jealous and alone
He wanted Milly for his own
A desperate craving in his bones
"Their love", he said, "I will not condone."

Then one day on a ship to Quebec
Floyd found Milly on a lover's trek
He picked up a bottle and broke off the neck
It sliced through the air, and Fee hit the deck

Oh, Fee, you're trying to live a life
That's completely free
You want to stay with Milly
Until you're dead
But you just got a bottle
Upside your head

Milly turned and began to scream at Floyd
said ""You think you're pretty mean""
And though she was as thin as a small string bean
She slammed him in the face with a nectarine

Floyd fell back over the edge of the ship
Till he hung from the rail by his fingertip
said, "Floyd I'll make you lose your grip
With this tiny piece of paper I can make you slip"

So Milly took that paper and did the deed
Floyd hit the water with astonishing speed
And as the sharks circled and began to feed
Milly knew her weasel was finally free

Oh, Fee, you're trying to live a life
That's completely free
Floyd is dead; he's nothing but a ripple
Cause Milly took that paper
And sliced him on the nipple

Fikus dreamed a dream for me
it cost me nothing it was free
he dreamed of walking in the sand
of blossoms forming in his hand

of kitchen cake and cedar shakes
of waterfalls and yellow snakes
of earthen dams and hydrofoils
of watching water 'til it boils

of holding forth from singing words
of flying south with flocks of birds
none of this was charged to me
for as I said it was for free

Fluffhead was a man
With a horrible disease
Could not find no cure
Wont you help him if you please?

Fluff came to my door
Askin me for change
His eyes were clear and pure
But his mind was so deranged

Fluff went to a banker
Askin for some bills
The banker said, "I aint got that
But I sure got some powerful pills."

I'm looking through
And it all would be
So crystal clear
If it wasn't for the foam
But the foam keeps getting thicker
And it just keeps getting harder
And I'm falling
Into a deep
Well

Time is me and I should know
I knew this several months ago
I knew more than I do now
For I've been turned around somehow

Relax the world will spin beside itself and suck you in
With threats and hopes beyond compare
Relax the world will spin beside itself and suck you in
With threats and hopes beyond compare

I change the landscape as I pass
Meandering from sand to glass
I suction there for one whole day
Until the feeling goes away

Relax the world will spin beside itself and suck you in
With threats and hopes beyond compare

I don't need these orbits in my life
Revolve and cycle through
Don't keep coming back for more

I don't need this circular design
Wheel and spin away from me
You've been by here before

Relax the world will spin beside itself and suck you in
With threats and hopes beyond compare
Relax the world will spin beside itself and suck you in
With threats and hopes beyond compare

I've lost my mind
I've lost my way
I'm bound to lose
You wonder where I am

I'm floating in the blimp a lot
I feel the feeling I forgot
of swimming weightless in the womb
or bouncing gently 'round the room
In a minute Ill be free
and youll be splashing in the sea

I feel no curiosity
I see the path ahead of me
in a minute I'll be free
and you'll be splashing in the sea
we'll hear a tiny cry
as the ship goes sliding by

I crashed, I burned
But then I learned
To keep my eye on you
You always say
You'll lead the way
But then you never do

I slowed, I swerved
But lost my nerve
And quickly looked away
When I looked back
The day was black
Then I heard you say

Why is the sun hot?
Why does it rain?
Why is there danger and
Why is there pain?
Why can't the burden we carry go away
And why isn't it Friday today?

Your lack of trust
Is hardly just
So do as you've been told
Please follow me
Into the sea
Don't worry if it's cold

I knew right then
My chance again
Would quickly slip away
I crash I cry
I burn but I
Still follow anyway

Why is the sea cool?
Why is it blue?
Why do I stay here?
Why is it you?
Notice the danger but don't help in any way
Why isn't it Friday today?

the mistress of the dawn strides along
with her solitary pawn who lingers on then is gone
with no word and no one heard where he went to this day
maybe he would sail away

the children of the sun having fun
didnt realize they were done because the pawn chanced to wander
through the camp just like a tramp he left his stamp there to this day
maybe he would sail away

gone are silent summer rains
wind is rolling off the plains
bringing ice upon the breeze
making flowing water freeze

the minstrel of the land made a stand in a castle built of sand
watched it fall in the frost and the message was lost
with one last word to deliver under ice upon the river it lies frozen to this day
maybe he would sail away

I went down to the guitar store and I got myself some things
Then I went home to fix this guitar to see if it could sing
When I got done I plugged it in but it made no sound at all
So I was gettin' pretty pissed so I plugged it into the wall

Guess it's not a singing type, it would rather yell and spit.
If you don't think you'll like this guitar then you're really askin' for shit!
`Cause when I get mad, I get red, and then I start to steam.
And this guitar is gonna fuck your face `cause it knows how to scream!

Hi, Im Bill. I was the one who did the cover art for the Stones <i>Sucking in the 70s</i> lp

I'm a sailor's girl, the best is yet to come
Rolling in my Fuego, I do my own stunts
I see guilty people, angels blowing horns

Some days it's just not worth gnawing through the straps
Freak out and throw stuff, World's Greatest Dad
Read a little book about Vlad the Impaler

Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh

Inside your Fuego, we keep it rolling
Inside your Fuego, we keep it rolling
Inside your Fuego, we keep it rolling
Inside your Fuego, we keep it rolling

I asked Diego if it was stolen
Inside your Fuego, we keep it rolling
Rolling, rolling, rolling
Diego, Diego, Diego

Gatekeeper, let me in
I've been trapped outside
And I'm ready to begin
I'll tell you the secret word, 
I can fill the form, 
or trade a gem
To be let aboard

People who've gone inside always rave
In there they learned a better way to behave
It's wild out here, and it's cold and lonely
And being in there is what I crave

Once I'm inside I'll live by the rules
And watch that I'm always sensitive
I'll work hard and raise my chin, 
as I vacuum out my old self
Turning all of it inside in

or the word may see
stands tall among the narrow firths
pillow wanderer of Gaul

The granite side slopes shed the tread of the romper crane
I swore I'd never speak their way again, and so it was

And then came the rains to pelt and round
their sound and image brought sense to the land world
a common magnificence stretched over, and there, and stars
stars as they they lifted the palms of their hand to their face

And their beings all would burble and melt with giggle
they would exclaim "reasonable children"
and take masterful chef for a walk

Then came the round sun
screaming them all into their little holes
sinking teeth into nails
wrapping tight cloth
incinerating all their little orange colored scraps
and waiting
waiting for the round ones
the round ones
the round ones

Some were taken
others, coaxed with bacos
their tiny little welts
were not heard
by the thundering feet any longer
and the strength of the beacon grew
searing cold over short bursts of time
travel and exercise were sporadically internalized
and eventually truncated from statute
there was no more time

My mind aches in remembrance
swift are the changes
all of them occur in one moment
but their perception takes a lifetime
and the pillow wandered smiles, indignant
the crane, in the mid-zone?
it's all in time, there is only in between

And you were there
you look out
you see you're standing there
you look out
you see from where you came
you look out
you walk on down the hall
you look out

There is no one in the doorway
you turn back
no, I'm sorry.. oh... holy... shit!
you look...

You walk on down the hall
you look in the door
there is a man at a table
he turns to look at you
you look out
there is no one in the doorway
you turn back to your plate
you look out
There is an old man lying in your bed
You look out.
There is no one at the table.

Gaul is at the foot of the bed
Gaul is the hole in the wall

I feel I've never told you 
the story of the ghost 
that I once knew and talked to 
of whom I'd never boast

But this was my big secret
how I get ahead
and never have to worry
I'd call him instead

His answer came in actions
He never spoke a word
Or maybe I lay down the phone 
before he could be heard

I somehow feel forsaken
Like he had closed the door
I guess I just stopped needing him
as much as once before

But maybe he's still with me 
the latch was left unhooked
He's waiting in the wind and rain
I simply haven't looked

And we're glad glad glad that you're alive
And we're glad glad glad that you'll arrive
And we're glad glad glad glad glad glad glad
And we're glad glad glad that you're a glide

I look into the finance box
Just to check my status
I look into the microscope
See Golgi Apparatus

Golgi, oh, woe is me
You can't even see the sea
Golgi, olgi, oh ooo olgi
Golgi
Golgi

They call him Lysosome
Cause he runs so fast
Runs like a junkyard dog
With a brain of brass

I saw you
With a ticket stub in your hand
Under the light
Middle of the night
Couldn't get it wrong
So I had to

Running from yourself
Come back from the dead
All those sleepless nights
All that pain
I'm sorry you're gone
But you're gone

When hope is nearly lost
You'll finally do what's right
Stop bleeding from your head anymore
The devil has you down
So turn around
And rise into the light

Running from yourself
(Spinning got you here)
Come back from the dead
(And there's no sun left in your eyes)
All those sleepless nights, all that pain
(You looked right through me)
I'm sorry you're gone
But you're gone
Left alone sleeping

When hope is nearly lost
(Gave with all your strength)
You'll finally do what's right
(Spoke with your eyes closed)
Stop bleeding from your head anymore
(I saw you dreaming like a child)
The devil has you down
(Cross the river with your friends)
So turn around
And rise into the light
(And rise into the light)

I can bend in sixty-eight ways
I have lived for twelve thousand days
Twenty-eight teeth inside of my head
Grind three types of things and I'm sad that they're dead

Aboard a craft bereft of oar
I rowed upstream to find Lenore
Abducted by a bandit or
A king from some forgotten war

And mindful of his larval craze
The rhinotropic micro-gaze
Ignored it and to my amazement
Rode to Paris in twelve days

This is the work of the guelah papyrus
Stranded for a moment on the ocean of Osyrus
Absorbing all she can for every member of her clan
Expanding exponentially like some recursive virus

She take me on, I never fail
To ride on the redundant rail
'Cause when I know she's switched a track
There's always one to take me back

And through the bedroom door intrude
A fretful frown and spoil the mood
'Cause though I never really stand that tall
She tilt my frame, she watch me fall

So maybe I could be a fly
And feed arachnid as I die
And view the ritual from within
The silken tunnel that they spin

And through the bedroom door intrude
A fretful frown and spoil the mood
'Cause though I never really stand that tall
She tilt my frame, she watch me fall

There's a mouse starin' out of the window
His car is trapped in the snow
He's planning a family vacation
But he just can't go
Around the next corner's a red bird
His feathers are trapped in a sling
He's passed by some gunslinging parrot (he's been trashed by some gunslinging parrot)
Who's jealous he ain't got no grin

There ain't no time to stash the gumbo
Or rattle around in a cage
The sacrificed child's made bubbles
And spittle is everywhere enraged
In THE hot sand *i render* I RAN ON my feet (in the hot sand i render my feet)
They're blistered and caked with debris
Chez rolez is guarding the tote board
While Angry piddles with glee

There's a fool writing notes out on sandpaper
He's sending them off to himself
He gets them a couple days later
Who put them along his top shelf
If you get tired of shavings
And carve up a good hunk of wood
Remembering to check on the sausage
He's got cooking somewhere look good (he's got cooking somewhere but good)

Guyute was the ugly pig
Who walked on me and danced a jig
That he had learned when he was six
Then stopped and did some other tricks

Like pulling weapons from his coat
and holding them against my throat
He lectured me in a language strange
Then scampered quickly out of range

I'm bouncing like a new born elf
I can't believe inside myself
Guyute glances in my eyes
and manages to hypnotize

me as I sleep the sleep of death
He sucks from me my only breath
That I had breathed since I was ten
I hope this happens once again

Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha
Ha ha ha ha

I close my eyes as the curtain draws
Ear toward the tracks
And ever after the rhythm soars
Flyin' right past the facts
Hold the times that I brought to light
Keep the pattern till June
Make the other side right
Half the way to the Moon
Im old enough to repeat myself
Im not tryin' to defend
Holdin' onto the thoughts I have
Back to circles again
Holdin' back the emotion train
Headin' back to Duluth
All aboard for the tour
Ridin' next to the truth

I found a place that I cant explain
In my state of mind
I move myself as I search the stone
For any lines to unwind
I grabbed some change when I thought I could
Left my wallet behind
I did my best to refine
I put my shoes out to shine
A little star that reveals itself
Little matter of time
Holdin' on to the thoughts I have/wheel I know
Not the devil I'll find
Raise the bar and roofbeams high
Help me carry this tune
Make the other side right
Half the way to the moon

Harry! Harry! 
Where do you go when the lights go out?
Harry! Harry! 
Where do you go when the lights go out?
Harry! Harry! 
Where do you go when the lights go out?
Harry! Harry! 
Where do you go?

Thank You, Mr. Minor
Thank You, Mr. Minor
Thank You, Mr. Minor

Thank You, Mr. Minor
Thank You, Mr. Minor
Thank You, Mr. Hood

You can feel good (I feel good) about Hood!
You can feel good (I feel good) about Hood!
You can feel good (I feel good) about Hood!
You can feel good (I feel good) about Hood!

[I feel GOOD!]

things have fallen down on me
heavy things I could not see
when I finally came around
something small would pin me down
when I tried
to step aside
I moved to where they'd hoped I'd be

Vanessa calls me on the phone
reminding me I'm not alone
I fuss and quake and cavitate
I try to speak and turn to stone

Tilly reaches through my vest
to do the thing that she does best
she probes and tears my ventricles
and steals my one remaining breath

things have fallen down on me
heavy things I could not see
when I finally came around
something small would pin me down
when I tried
to step aside
I moved to where they'd hoped I'd be

stumbling as I fall from Grace
she needs my vision to replace
her ailing sight throughout the night
leaving two holes in my face

Mary was a friend I'd say
until one summer day
she borrowed everything I own
and simply ran away

things have fallen down on me
heavy things I could not see
when I finally came around
something small would pin me down
when I tried
to step aside
I moved to where they'd hoped I'd be

Now that you've deceived me, and played my name around
And hung those nasty flyers, on all the buildings in town
Dribbled my possessions in a ring around the earth
And bought and sold my self-control for less than it was worth

Now I know the reason that I'm feeling so forlorn
I'll pick you up at eight as usual, listen for my horn

I been around a while
I lived in town a while
I threw it down a while
And the town threw down on me

(Still here)
(Oh yeah)

I been around a while
I lived in town a while
I threw it down a while
And the town threw down on me

I been around a while
I lived in town a while
I threw it down a while
And the town threw down on me

Sliding down that final stretch of highway
I pass beside you and my mind comes alive
Got to find a way to the person inside
Skip my turn and follow you to a city
I scale the walls of a highrise to the sky
And I see you yelling and I don't know why

I'm hiding in that empty room
Behind a pile of impending doom
It must have been a bad idea; gotta stop stackin' it up
I don't know why I got so lost; and how long; I've been gone

You're meeting with an owl tycoon at a conference table
Another sketch of a higher tower is drawn
And your voice is becoming my favorite song
As the knights of reason stand in the way clanging
I step out and plead until they take me away
But another idea begins to inflate

On chairs stacked up to your room
I serenade you with a thought balloon that says
It must have been a bad idea to start stacking it up
I don't know why it got so lost; and how long; I've been gone

You built an ancient town from rocks and bones
On sand they find your glossy tower sheens
Waves crash up and the spires beam
From the top of the world you scope out what you know
But standing way up there makes you feel all alone
With the odds stacked against me I walk up slow

Piece by piece you break your wall down
And as it tumbles to the ground you say
It must have been a bad idea to keep stackin' it up
I don't know why I got so lost; and how long; I've been gone

Take me to another place, she said 
Take me to another time 
Run with me across the oceans 
Float me on a silver cloud 

If I could I would, but I don't know how 
If I could I would, but I don't know how 
If I could I would and I'd take you now 

Stay with me till time turns over 
I want to feel my feet leave the ground 
Take me where the whispering breezes 
Can lift me up and spin me around 

If I could I would... 
Hear you laughing as we go 
Flipping backward through the doors and through the windows...
I'm melting into nothing 

If I could I would, but I don't know how 
If I could I would, but I don't know how 
If I could I would and I'd take you now

It happened to me at the water tower
I was on my way home on a misty night
Dreaming of dinner and a shower
A chill in the air, there wasnt a soul in sight
When I stepped on a stick
I started to slip
And I fell in a hole

Well it seemed that the hole was never-ending
And deeper I fell into the silent black
Picking up speed my body bending
I was starting to think that I would never come back
When the air became thick
The air became cold
And everything froze

I tried to move but wasnt able
I found myself frozen in a block of ice
I pictured by dinner on the table
A plate of asparagus would sure taste nice
When everything shook
The ice began to crack
And I felt it explode

I knew that at last I had escaped the violence
And headed for home as fast as I could run
I felt myself floating in the silence
And I pictured the water tower and the rising sun
But I didnt look down
I stepped on a stick
And I fell in a hole

I'm in a hole
I'm in a hole
I'm in a hole
I'm in a hole


While lying in a misty glade
The stars abve begin to fade
Before approaching dawn
I watch the tide begin to swell
And wash across the quay

Across the sky an image flies
If it were not for my disguise
You'd understand the view
Just yesterday I thought of you
While I was watching in queue

Recalling how your eyes would glow
A thing of beauty it would seem
Those eyes are gone
I am alone

I press on the elastic sheet, I'm breathing through a slice
'Are they worms or are the serpents?' bubbles through the ice
The source was quite invisible, the ever-present voice
While skating, both legs tracing different shapes, I made my choice

I'm mimicking the image in whose radiance I bask
I'm tied to him, or him to me, depending who you ask
None the less reluctantly reflections tumble in
I slide with all the other on the wrong side of the skin

He's fallen on the ice, it cracks
Will he plunge in and join me here?
He meets my eyes, to my surprise
He laughs in full light of my frown
My double wants to pull me down

Slipping on the friction slide, my skin peels to the bone
The flesh I leave behind, is something that is not my own
I beg my mirror image for a moment with my soul
He's leaning back, time to attack, it's me who's in control

And every move I make he's got a hand up just in time
He's throwing several punches, and he's blocking most of mine
Defeated now I sulk and squirm above the frozen heights
Waiting, calculating till he ventures onto the ice.

Joy is over there in her incredible clothes
She has silver silk shimmering down to her toes
I was doing the best that I can I suppose
But that little girl dancer eventually grows 
She grows

You cant imagine all the times that I tried 
To uncover the source of the tears that you cried
Lets throw it away and just go for a ride
And youd say ok but youd keep it inside
And I tried

We want you to be happy
Dont live inside the gloom
We want you to be happy
Come step outside your room
We want you to be happy
Cause this is your song too

I never thought I could have it so good
You were the song that my soul understood 
But time is a river that flows through the woods
And it led us to place we both understood
Would be gone
Before too long

When we were young we thought life was a game
But then somebody leaves you and youre never the same
All of the places and people belong 
To the puzzle but one of the pieces is gone
And its you
Joy, its you

We want you to be happy
Dont live inside the gloom
We want you to be happy
Come step outside your room
We want you to be happy
Cause this is your song too

In time well weather this storm
Inside together youll see the change
When the sun shines through

We want you to be happy
Dont live inside the gloom
We want you to be happy
Come step outside your room
We want you to be happy
Cause this is your song too

Danger
I've been told to expect it 
I begin my descent 
Down the cold granite steps 

And who could have turned among those I confide in? 
I think that I know what I haven't known yet 
'Cause a week is a month 
and an hour a day 
When your reaching just pushes it further away 
With your past and your future precisely divided 
Am I at that moment? I haven't decided 

And stretching out into the sea... Aquitana 
Is that what the prophet told me he saw? 
You gave it to me but I really don't want it 
I came out on top by the luck of the draw 
'Cause a week is a month and an hour a day 
When your reaching just pushes it further away 
And what's the return on the faith I've provided?
I think that I know now but I haven't decided

Don't take another, don't take another, don't take another step
Don't blame it on yourself
Then you'll lay it on ya brotha when your sleeping
You'll wake up in the morning and he'll be gone

Before you take another step
Don't blame it on yourself
'Cause if you lay it on a brother when he's sleeping
You'll wake up in the morning and he'll be gone

Just got back from Kill Devil Falls
Draped my water-logged clothes in the hall
Reach for a beer, glad that Im here
When I realize that youre not around

Turned on some music and then the tv
Go through the pile of mail waiting for me
Something I spied makes me pull it aside
A letter from your hometown

How could you leave me?
You heard what I said
Id be at the waterfall clearing my head
Soaking up nature and thinking of you
And leavings the last thing I thought you would do
I didnt plan to stop at the bar
But Kill Devil Falls is really so far
Who knew a day would turn into a week
But I learned my lesson
And I can still remember the last one
But this time will be different
Until I do it again

Stared at the ceiling for over a day
But none of my questions are answered this way
Wont make any calls
Ill just bounce off the walls 
Til I go back to Kill Devil Falls

I stand at the base of the mountain
Dont follow me
And I step right up to the cliff side
Better learn how to leap
And I stare straight into the future
Tell me what do you see
That this times gonna be different

Dont go back to Kill Devil Falls

Kung... Kung...
Rich in minerals
Rich in firth
Kang well in martin land
Fervent fourth
Mere Fervent fifth
Forever aroul we curl
Be it ever so
Voraciously alternate
We call upon your bot
Can we stand?
Can we stare?
We can stage a runaway golfcart marathon!
Stand up!!
Stand up!!
Stand up on your heels and call
From the hills..
From the hills..
From the hills...

Throughout the night
When there's no direct light
And a thin veil of clouds
Keeps the stars out of sight

I can smell the colors
Outside on my lawn
The moist green organic
That my feet tread upon

And the black oleander
Surrounded by blues
I'm soon overwhelmed
By olfactory hues

When you're there, I sleep lengthwise
And when you're gone
I sleep diagonal in my bed

Gonna take my bike out
gonna take my bike
gonna ride it slowly
gonna ride just how I like

Gonna take my bike out
gonna take my bike
gonna ride it slowly
gonna ride just how I like

Leave me way up here
up on the mountain
let me lie uncovered
on the floor

Make me wonder when
you go away again
if you're ever 
coming back here anymore

Gonna take my bike out
gonna take my bike
gonna ride it slowly
gonna ride just how I like

Gonna take my bike out
gonna take my bike
gonna ride it slowly

I don't care what you did
but I can tell its hanging over you
the effects of sun and sand
are hard to understand

So leave me way up here
up on the mountain
let me lie, ooh

Gonna take my bike out
(gonna) take my bike
gonna ride it slowly
gonna ride just how I like

Gonna use my brakes
when I go downhill
Gonna climb back on 
when I take a spill

Gonna peel my shirt off
gonna feel it burn
gonna keep my eyes closed
gonna miss my turn

Gonna take my bike out
(gonna) take my bike
gonna ride it slowly

Let me lie
Let me lie
Let me lie
Let me lie

Gonna take my bike out
(gonna) take my bike
(Let me lie)
gonna ride it slowly
gonna ride just how I like
(Let me lie)

Gonna take my bike out
(gonna) take my bike
(Let me lie)
gonna ride it slowly
gonna ride just how I like
(Let me lie)

Gonna use my breaks
when I go downhill
Gonna climb back on 
when I take a spill

Gonna take my bike out
gonna take my bike
gonna ride it slowly
gonna ride just how I like

Gonna peel my shirt off
gonna feel it burn
gonna keep my eyes closed
gonna miss my turn

Gonna take my bike out
gonna take my bike
gonna ride it slowly
gonna ride just how I like

Swinging on the lifeline 
Fraying bits of twine
Entangled in the remnants of the
Knot I left behind
And asking you to help me make it
Finally unwind

But God never listens to what I say
God never listens to what I say
And you don't get a refund
If you overpray

And when the line is breking
And when I'm near the end
When all the time spent leading
I've been following instead
When all my thoughts and memories are
Left hanging by a thread

God never listens...
Stranded on this slender string
The minutes seem to last a lifetime
Dangling here between the light above
And blue below that drags me down

But God never listens to what I say
God never listens to what I say
And you don't get a refund
If you overpray


The shoulder that I leaned on was carved out of stone 
But when I'm done freezing I want to be alone

Never want my hand cut off 
Never want a hacking cough 
Never need a cliffside push 
Never turn my brain to mush

Always give me what I lack 
Always take the best parts back 
Always recognize your fate 
Always just a moment late 

Left is where I always turn 
Left is how I'm forced to learn 
Left the route my walking takes 
Left alone with my mistakes 

Up against a person who 
Up 'til now I never knew 
Up from hell the answer blew 
Up and down it's up to you. 

Drop me off the chinese wall 
and peel my fingers off the rim
I come unglued while in mid-air 
and land to reform 
limb by limb 

And I am taken far away....

Lingering slowly and melting away
Tossed with the salad and baled with the hay
Pooling like water that drips from above
Trampled by lambs and pecked by the dove

The sea is so wide
And the boat is so small
And the sun burns my skin
In this liquid time

But time is a treasure here
Cuz it flows in every direction
I know you understand
But might not recognize
That it's easier to look at things this way

And though I know it was a lie that got me here
The stars at night are moving
In a heavenly dance
I can smell the rain
Taste the wind
See the sand
It's not so far away

Oh, sad, sad one
I feel you growing dim
And the clouds disperse around me
And I know these dreams are real

Tryin' to recognize
Liquid time
Trying to recognize
Liquid time

Rolling, rolling
(I know you're watching me)
The sea, the sea

Sunrise over the turquoise mountains
Messenger birds in sight
They came up through the valley
Both sides at a time
Through the cold steady rain
Raid!
I bend down
Poke a double decker on a llama, Taboot
Llama, Taboot Taboot
Trigger a blastoplast, ramshackle laker recedes
I start to run
It was the loudest thing I'd ever heard
And I knew my time had come
To enter the delta

Hey, Makisupa policeman
Policeman came to my house
Hey, Makisupa policeman
Policeman came to my house

Woke up this morning...

The overhead view is of me in a maze
And you see what I'm hunting a few steps away
And I take a wrong turn and I'm on the wrong path
And the people all watching enjoy a good laugh

Embarrassed with failure, I try to reverse
The course that my tread had already traversed
So doing the trauma engulfing my dream
Invaded through what was an unguarded seam
The torrent of helplessness swept me away
To the cavern of shame and the hall of dismay
Inside me a voice was repeating this phrase:
"You've lost it, you'll never get out of this maze"
You'll never get out of this maze

I am a prince I have it all
I hear your footsteps through the wall
I wait in silence for your call
then take a shot and watch you fall

I am a ghost but I cannot fly
I'm stuck here as the years slide by
I need a resting place 'cause I
already felt my body die

if I had a host of ghosts
living on my street
I'd jive and strive to stay alive
and offer them some meat

I need a different life I think
perhaps I'd be the missing link
and treasure moments as I drink
away the memories let them sink

Oh tequila I turn to you like a long lost friend
I want to kiss my Mexican cousin once again
We'll cover every emotion from happiness to sorrow
And the conversations I forget you'll tell me about tomorrow
When the phone calls start, am I in bed or in a hearse?
The things you tell me about myself can't make me feel any worse
Well I'm awful sorry you got pissed
Just have to cross you off the list
Of my true friends...
And tequila's where that starts and where it ends

Trapped in time and I don't know what to do
These friends of mine, I can see right through.
You don't gotta tell me that I don't gotta move
'Cause I'm just sittin' back here sharing in the groove.
Me no are no nice guy

I walk through the hallways inside my mind
I chase the backbeat falling behind
Big dude in the doorway blocking my way
He reached and grabbed me and this is what he said:
Me no are no nice guy

Zither, Rachel, Cardamom, Frost - But at what cost?
Threshold, Skin, Fortress, Win - A life of sin
Pliers, Tension, Toy Store, Grace - The human race
Raking, Fourteen, Basket, Screw - Now how 'bout you?
Passion, Cardboard, Raisin, Stop - A better crop
Field, Cater, Open, New - Who's mocking who?
It's just a mock song...

Gas, Thirsty, Rattle, Tick - A bone to pick
Fountain, Egg, Treason, Cave - Will you dance on grave?
Throat, Carrot, Meeting, Choke -I got that joke
Temper, Thistle, Rodney, Wilt - The house I built
Fewer, Pink, Kyle, Ball - I've known them all
Penny, Thistle, Cell Phone, Blow - Reap what you sow
Because it's just a mock song
Call it what you will.

The old man knows very well
Going down by the snowbank, there's a mound
A mound that an old man knows good
Look who raises his shoe all over this mound
Right over the world that's another rewind

And it's time, time, time for the last rewind
For a broken old man and a world unkind
He buried all his memories of home
In an icy clump that lies beneath the ground

No one knows how far he traveled
Oh! I heard he walked miles from the little mound
Can he find some shelter?
He doesn't know to behold what the cold frost can do
And at last till he realized he'd circled back around
Round a back circle, round a back realized

Ice is all he was made of
The bitter blue, and frozen through
He went over to the mound
Reclining down his final thoughts
Were drifting to the time this life had shined

My friend, my friend he's got a knife
A statement from his former life
When he was easy but alone
Beside him was an empty throne
But what of silver silken blade
Affix his gaze, his features staid
Grasps the handle, clips the cable
One steps up, sits at his table
My friend, my friend, he's got a knife
My friend, my friend, he's got a wife

My friend, my friend, the clever ruse
Persuasion through his thoughts peruse
A hidden relic from his past
That wasn't there when he looked last
He feels it ticking like a bomb
Feeding fear, assaulting calm
Takes the object, starts the game
Moves closer to the flame

My friend, my friend, the clever ruse
My friend, my friend, he lights the fuse

My friend, my friend, he's got a knife
My friend, my friend, he's got a knife
My friend, my friend, he's got a knife
Myf

Didnt get no sleep last night
I was thinking about today
Try to keep things simple
But my brain gets in the way

I said you need to rest now
But my big head dont care
Now I can see
That thats gonna be 
My problem right there

My problem right there
My problem right there
My powerful mind 
is my problem right there

I got no other problems
Of which Im aware
Im just too damn smart
Thats my problem right there

Now Peaches from Tulsa
Is calling again
I remember the time
I went home with her friend

Now they both say theyre coming
To be my side
Aint no room in this truck
To take three for a ride

My problem right there
My problem right there
These women round here
Are my problem right there

And I could handle them all
But they dont like to share
I got too much love
Thats my problem right there

Now I could stay up all night
No problem, ok
But Im often inclined
To sleep through the day

In the shade of the heat
I can nap anywhere
And thats gonna be
My problem right there

My problem right there
My problem right there
Brains, women and sleep
Are my problem right there

Now look what this cap
Has now done to my hair
(Looks like you got)
(One more problem right there)

Now I drank the last pull
From my best corn liquor
Got nothing to eat
But this half melted Snickers

And the bills they just keep 
coming quicker and quicker
And that ol bill collector
He gets slicker and slicker

And Mr Policeman
Is looking for me
And I got this strange rash
Aint no sting from a bee

But I got no other problems
Of which Im aware
Except Ive lost everything
And I dont really care

My problem right there
My problem right there
These problems right here
Are my problem right there

And theyll probably keep coming
Til I stop breathing air
Then thats gonna be
My biggest problem right there

Problem right there
My problem right there
(My problem right there) x3

My sweet one, I'll call you my sweet one
You're my only true sweet one
With my all, I'll call you my sweet one
From far away, I'll say your name

Oh with you, I'd travel thick
And with you, I'd also travel thin
And all the spaces in between
I'd travel with you, you're my sweet one

But for now I must sit here and ponder the yonder
Herbivores ate well cause their food didn't never run
Oh, if You're ever unsatisfied with the way life's treating You
You know You can count on me to take good care of You

I love you honey oh yes I do
You know that's true of course
and if your dog or cat ever dies,
I'll buy you a ewe

My sweet one, I'll call you my sweet one
You're my only true sweet
With my all, I'll call you my sweet one
Far awaaaaaa-ay
I'll say your name

never is a point in time
that doesn't have dimension
always is the measure of
how long time's been around

it also points ahead
but that's beyond my grasp
I'm rooted in the now
and that's what keeps me on the ground, remembering

never to forget that I 
forgot you for awhile

Appendages flailing, you're running at me
Ferocious tenaciously, clawing at me
The devious gelatin holding me fast
Miraculous now, you let me ooze past

Over the wall, rushing rivers of sleaze
The tip of stalactites incising my knees
A slipper, a sand dollar, day at the shore
Nice evening at home that I dread even more

Would you please make clear to me
I'm peering out through your opacity
Though you rehearse tomorrow's verse
Forgive me if I don't sing in your key

Back on those days when my life was a haze
The gelatin lay on a truncated sleigh
Copernicus drank from a vessel that stank
From the free mason's crank to the overflow tank

Bane of the weasel for biting/biding is fun
Jump on the turnstile and watch me go round
Swim with the cactus (ssssssss) and float with the stone
I try to convey what you strive to condone

Would you please make clear to me
I'm peering out through your opacity
Though you rehearse tomorrow's verse
Forgive me if I don't sing in your key

...Play it Leo!!

Would you please make clear to me
I'm peering out through your opacity
Though you rehearse tomorrow's verse
Forgive me if I don't sing in your key

Would you please (No left turn unstoned) make clear to me (When you see me)
Why nothing is the first thing that I see
And if you do (No left turn unstoned) And I see you (When you see me)
Then you will be the nothing left for me

Would you please (No left turn unstoned) make clear to me (When you see me)
Why nothing is the first thing that I see
And if you do (No left turn unstoned) And I see you (When you see me)
Then you will be the nothing left for me

No Dogs allowed
No Dogs allowed 
No Dogs allowed in the subway today 

So climb up the stairs 
And be on your way 
'Cause there's no dogs allowed in the subway today

If dogs were allowed then just think of this place 
A city of dogs living here in this space 
Whining and running from dawn until dark 
My head would be aching from hearing them bark

So there's 
No Dogs allowed
No Dogs allowed
No Dogs allowed in the subway today

So climb up the stairs
And be on your way
'Cause there's no dogs allowed in the subway today

If dogs were allowed then the people would shout 
And tell me to order those dirty dogs out 
I'd have to decide who would get to sit down 
Would the dogs or the people ride into town

So there's 
No Dogs allowed
No Dogs allowed 
No Dogs allowed in the subway today 

So climb up the stairs
And be on your way
'Cause there's no dogs allowed in the subway today

If dogs were allowed then the trains would be filled 
With creatures that never, no never stand still
There wouldn't be room for the people at all 
The trains would be cluttered with dogs big and small

Nothings ensconced
Nothings entrenched
Nothings entangled or twisted or wrenched
Everything smoothly flows right through my head
What I hoped might linger is swept off instead

Tunnels and channels and chasms and rifts
Shiny smooth streams and unclimbable cliffs
I see you there ever so slowly being drawn to the sea
As if by some signal thats unheard by me

I stand on a featureless sheet of blue stone
And then for one instant Im not quite alone
Your hand is extended but then you rescind
And you like my thoughts are borne off by the wind

Ocelot! Ocelot! 
Where have you gone?
Morning is over
and noon slouches on 

Your stripes could all fade 
in the poisonous day 
When you see the sunlight
move out of the way 

You prance with the beasts 
who parade every night 
And silently slouch 
through the forest by light 
Dont be the only one left on the block 
Come hide in the herd
and float with the flock 

Ocelot! Ocelot! 
Where are you now? 
You never listen to me anyhow 
You wandered and ambled
you walked, now you run 
Knowing youll bake 
like a snake in the sun 
You prance with the beasts 
you parade every night 
And silently slouch 
through the forest twilight 

Dont be the only one left on the block 
Come hide in the heard
and float with the flock 

You prance with the beasts 
you parade every night 
And silently slouch 
through the forest twilight 

Dont be the only one left on the block 
Come hide in the heard
and float with the flock 

Ocelot! Ocelot! 
Where have you gone?
(Wont you come out to play?) 
Ocelot! Ocelot! 
Where have you gone?
(Wont you come out to play?) 
Ocelot! Ocelot! 
Where have you gone?
(Wont you come out to play?) 

Last night laying in bed
I woke up from something you said
You spoke to me in a foreign tongue
It wasn't your voice so I started to run

A spiral staircase swallowed me
And spit me out in the woods by a tree
I felt the bark for a passage out
I froze in panic 'til I figured it out

It's only a dream
It's only a dream
It's not what it seems
It's only a dream

You faded up from black and pushed me aside
I was blocking your view of a circular sky
I could tell by your hand shaking in fear
That my worries were real; the devil was near

Back in real life I had shaken your trust
The devil enticed me to trade it for lust
You walked the high wire on the light of a beam
You screamed and I realized the devil was me

It's only a dream
It's only a dream
And I can change the scene
It's only a dream

It's only a dream
And it's lucid

It's only a dream
It's a lucid dream

Up the beam I follow your shout
An egg cracked open and the sun came out
I spoke my remorse for all I had done
You aimed at my eyes and shot me the sun
You faded out and I was all alone
In a train station laying on a bench of stone
I heard the train coming but it never appeared
'Til it fell from the sky, confirming my fear

That it's only a dream
It's only a dream
It's not what it seems
It's only a dream
It's only a dream
It's only a dream
In orange and green
It's only a dream

She started a blaze from one tiny spark
I didn't even detect
She loved the light, was dismayed by the dark
The stars though she seemed to respect

The faint light that flutters at night to the earth
Would land in her eyes and collect
Luminous creatures she'd find in the surf
I never thought to inspect

Pebbles and marbles like things on my mind
Seem to get lost and harder to find
When I am alone I am inclined
If I find a pebble in sand
To think that it fell from my hand

She gave me ideas
Planted the seed
But she never stopped to reflect
The course that she's on, wherever it leads
I never would redirect

Pebbles and marbles like words from a friend
Make us hold tight but are lost in the end
When we're alone we all seem to tend
If we find a marble in dust
To wish someone left it for us

I'm halfway, fully, nearly, close to just beyond it
Right beside and just a hair's breadth, in between, next to and closer
I'm approximately, roughly, more or less, about exactly
Almost close by and adjacent
Handy local, within hailing
But the cloud then passes over
And you're vague aloof and distant
Isolated and secluded
Far flung, far off and remote
You're faint and hazy indistinct
Your pigtail has been dipped in ink
Dipped in ink

Reserved you wander unattached,
Till the sun comes out at last
Somehow, you comprehend, and I'm becoming conscious again
I'm becoming conscious again
Unconscious again
I'm conscious again
Unconscious again
I'm conscious again
Unconscious again
I'm conscious again
Unconscious again
Unconscious again
Appreciate, grasp, and recognize our mutually proximate prize

And if the stars line up tonight
Then you and I will be all right
If the planets don't align
You go your way, I'll go mine
I don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind

Your pigtail dipped in ink
I'm conscious again
Unconscious again
Your pigtail dipped in ink
I'm conscious again
Unconscious again
Your pigtail dipped in ink
I'm conscious again
Unconscious again
Your pigtail dipped in ink
I'm conscious again
Unconscious again

I'm conscious again
Unconscious again (x8)

Piper, Piper, the red, red worm
woke last night to the sound of the storm
her words were words I sailed upon

No matter how you slice your day
or dream of places far away
or try to set your world apart
You always end up where you start

A bunch of cells below the soil
Some plasma in a lake of oil
I don't think that when I depart
I'll be close to where I start

You won't steal my poor heart again
You won't steal my poor heart again
You won't steal my tape recorder
I'll call the Lord and he'll put you in the pen
You won't steal that thing again

I didn't even know your name or what was your game
But stealin' things has sure brought you to fame
I wanna know if you stole mine
It was one of a kind and I'm sayin' if you're to blame
Your life will never be the same

You won't steal my poor heart again
You won't steal my poor heart again
You won't steal my tape recorder
I'll call the Lord and he'll put you in the pen
You won't steal that thing again

I can't track you anymore
Detective work has sure become a bore
So tell me what you did with it
And stop this shit, give up yourself
Before they come knockin' at your door

You won't steal my poor heart again
You won't steal my poor heart again 
When I feel the blade of that Cupid sword
I'll call the Lord and he'll put you in the pen
You won't steal that thing again
You won't steal my poor heart again 

Oh, to be Prince Caspian, afloat upon the waves
Oh, to be Prince Caspian, afloat upon the waves
Oh, to be Prince Caspian, afloat upon the waves
Oh, to be Prince Caspian
with nothing to return to but the demons in their caves

Oh, to be Prince Caspian, afloat upon the waves
Oh, to be Prince Caspian, afloat upon the waves
Oh, to be Prince Caspian, afloat upon the waves
Oh, to be Prince Caspian
And the children in the fields are sowing seed and chaffing wheat
oh to be Prince Caspian with stumps instead of feet

Oh, to be Prince Caspian

I come from the land where the oceans freeze
Spent three long months on the open seas
Paddled 'til it seemed I could take no more
When my ship hit ground on Prussia's shores

How was I to know that day
That the winds had swept me Wilson's way
'Cause soon towards me from the East
Came Wilson and his men on multi-beasts

Well it seems he didn't like my face
And I quickly learned that Prussia was an evil place
They tied me to a chair with a giant clip
And held a piece of paper to my tender nip(ple)

Then they tossed the chair in a tiny shack
And told me not to worry 'cause they'd soon be back
But I loosened up the binds where my hands were lashed
And ran towards the cove where my boat was stashed

Singing "Oh Wilson, someday I'll kill you 'til you die
Oh Wilson, Punch you in the Eye"

When Wilson knew that I was loose
I'd surely be subjected to some real abuse
Maybe end up hanging from the nearest tree
So angrily I paddled to the open sea

But the sea was eager to beat me back
And the waves grew huge and deadly black
And the gray clouds rumbled over my head
And I feared in my heart that I'd soon be dead

When the morning came and the storm had passed
And the dismal fog began at last
To open up before my eyes
And there I saw to my surprise

Chains and specks of islands curved
Where palm trees dipped and seagulls swerved
And I parked my kayak on a stone
And yelled across the ocean to his evil throne

I said "Oh Wilson, someday I'll kill you 'til you die
Oh Wilson, Punch you in the Eye
Wilson, kill you 'til you die
Oh Wilson, Punch you in the Eye" 

Reba sink a boulder in the water
Reba tie a cable to a tree
Reba stuck in a game of lipstick perfume flypaper
Reba press a razor to a slide cross a needle with a prune

Knee deep in the motel tub
Reba dangle ladle form her lip
dip
sip
Reba babble to the nag with the lipstick perfume
mutter to a farmer in a truck

Take a peek at the cheetah, Reba
cheetah on the prowl in a cage
sink a boulder in the water
tie a cable to a tree

Mutter "nature" to the nag
with the lipstick perfume
Reba flush a fleshfarm leftover
thunder in a circle
down the pipes

Bag it
Tag it
Sell it to the butcher in the store

Reba put a stopper in the bottom of the tub
picked up a jar unscrewed the top
and watched it drop into the water

A little scoop of plaster mix
some coffee grounds and mud
and then she stirred it with the ladle
that her Grandmother had bought her
threw in a pot of melted wax
a forefoot and a hoof
apple core, worms galore
and a can of some corrosive

coconuts and chloroform
some wicker and some cork
Toxic waste, some purple paste
she hoped was not explosive

Reba dip a ladle for a taste of her creation
and she knew that what she make
would be the finest in the nation

Last night, in the moments my thoughts were adrift
And coasting a terrace, approaching a rift
Through which I could spy several glimpses beneath
Of the darkness the light from above could not reach
I spied wings of reason, herself taking flight
And upon yonder precipice saw her alight
And glared back at me one last look of dismay
As if she were the last one she thought I'd betray

So much better I said to myself
And drawing quite close to the top of the shelf
I struggled with destiny upon the ledge
And gasped when defeated he slipped off the edge
And silence contagious in moments like these
Consumed me and strengthened my will to appease
The passion that sparked me one terrible night
And shocked and persuaded my soul to ignite

So much better I said to myself
And drawing quite close to the top of the shelf

And gasped when defeated he slipped off the edge

And silence contagious in moments like these
Consume me and strengthen my will to appease

The passion that sparked me one terrible night
And shocked and persuaded my soul to ignite

The circus is the place for me with bears and clowns and noise
I love the shiny music that descends from overhead
Gordon knew the moment when the stars all turned around
But from that vantage point I frowned

If life were easy and not so fast
I wouldn't think about the past.
I can't forget to turn the earth so both sides get their share 
of darkness and of light

So now I wander over grounds of light and heat and sound and mist
provoking dreams that don't exist
A circus of light where dreams can take flight
In the peacefulness dreaming dreams brings

Been you to have any spike, man?

(Run run run run run run run run run run run run)

Walk into the supermarket
Watch the electronic doors open magically as you step onto the black pad
Slowly walk down the aisle toward the produce section

(Run run run run run run run run run run run run)
(Roll roll roll roll roll roll roll roll roll roll roll roll)

Past the oranges
Past the McIntosh apples
Overlook the avocados
Past the vegetables
Head towards the ripe fruit that lies in front of you, like a beacon!

You see it!
You reach out your hand!
You lift the fruit into the air!
You raise you arm!
And you! And you!

Youve got to roll like a cantaloupe, out of control!
Roll like a cantaloupe, out of control!
Roll like a cantaloupe, out of control!
Roll like a cantaloupe, out of control!

My room is round when I lay down, when I wake up it's square
When I go outside it's on a spiral set of stairs
The people that surround me are waiting out there
In a round room they can't find me anywhere

Right angle rooms drive me crazier each day
Put me in a box I know I'm never going to play
Put me in a square room and I won't know what to say
I want a round room at the end of the day

I had an apartment, four corners on the walls
Couldn't eat, couldn't sleep there at all
I want a curve to the place where I stay
I want a round room at the end of the day

If I pass out take me to the Round Church
Where echoes resound
And my spirit is found
And when I float high
Take my arm and I'll fly you by
The outskirts of town, to a garden that's round

I went to the lighthouse and I liked the view
I looked out the window and I could see you
Put me in a square house and I won't have a clue
I want a round room just to be with you.

Rye, rye, Rocco

I had a dog. His name was Jim
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)
Took all of my old clothes with him.
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)

Whoa-ooooooooooooooo oh Runaway Jim
Whoa-ooooooooooooooo oh Runaway Jim

He was twelve years old when his trip began,
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)
Hauling down the highway in my old sedan.
(Runaway, runaway, runaway.)

Whoa-ooooooooooooooo oh Runaway Jim
Whoa-ooooooooooooooo oh Runaway Jim

Now I wish someone'd tell me where old Jim went,
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)
'Cause he took all the money that I saved for rent.
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)

Whoa-ooooooooooooooo oh Runaway Jim
Whoa-ooooooooooooooo oh Runaway Jim

By the time he came home he was seventeen.
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)
That's a hundred nineteen to you and me.
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)

Whoa-ooooooooooooooo oh Runaway Jim
Whoa-ooooooooooooooo oh Runaway Jim

Now I'm gonna go up to the mountain.
(Runaway, runaway, runaway)
Singing for Jim who's swimming in the fountain.
(Runaway, runaway, runaway 

Whoa-ooooooooooooooo oh Runaway Jim
Whoa-ooooooooooooooo oh Runaway Jim

A flash of light
another moment stolen from my soul
A thunderclap
again I must surrender all control

Sudden noises startle me 
and strange things in my mind
Haunt me and I'm running scared
Running out of time
Running out of time

There are days when sunlight
seems to lift me from my bed
And other times I face the light
with eyelids full of lead

Light and dark pass quickly by
with no dividing line
I follow but I'm running scared
Running out of time (running out of time)
Running out of time (running out of time)
Running out of time

Never been chosen (running out of time)
Selected, preferred (running out of time)
Singled out of favor (running out of time)
As far as I've heard (running out of time)

Its a red mark on my shoulder, and so
Maybe god touched me
and I didn't know (running out of time)


It's hidden far away
But someday I may tell
The tale of metal tangle
When into your world I fell
Without you now I wander soaking
Secretly afraid
'Cause in your grasp the fears don't last
(And some of them have stayed)

I wheeled around because I
Didn't hear what you had said
And saw you dancing with Elihu
Up on Leemor's bed
And I was foggy rather groggy, you helped me to my car
The binding belt enclosing me, a Sample in a Jar

And on the market stands unfolding
With all their willies and their wares
I shuffle by alert but numb
To all the glances and the glares
And I think of you unheeding
All the times I raise my cup
It's now I know that you knew that
I'd soon end up end up 

You tricked me like the others
And now I don't belong
The simple smiles and good times seem all wrong

if you can heal the symptoms
but not affect the cause
its quite a bit like trying to heal
a gunshot wound with gauze

if you instead attempt to wrest
the pistol from the hand
then I would not be able to
equate my life with sand

flowing through the hourglass
pushing through the funnel
turn once more while racing
all your siblings for the tunnel

slide and let the silicone
embrace you as you fall
then bounce and land you let
your brothers crush you to the wall

I would choose my own religion
and worship my own spirit
but if he ever preached to me
I wouldnt want to hear it

Id drop him, a forgotten god,
languishing in shame
and then if I hit stormy seas
Id have myself to blame

Sanity never came my way
(came his way)
sanity never came my way
(his way)
I don't know what I'll do today
(way)
'Cause sanity never came my way

Lost my mind just a couple of times
(lost his mind)
lost my mind just a couple of times
(his mind)
you can spend your nickels, you can spend your dimes
(mind)
but I lost my mind just a couple of times

You can trespass anywhere
(a-ny-where)
You can trespass anywhere
(ny-where)
but where you go, you'd better beware
(where)
you can trespass anywhere

I forgot the rules, I forgot my pride
('got his pride)
but I don't need a place to hide
(his pride)
I forgot the rules, I forgot my pride
(pride)
But I don't need a place to hide!

The stars in the sky are very bright
(stars are bright)
the stars in the sky are very bright
(are bright)
the stars they really suck tonight!
(stars suck)
the stars in the sky are very bright

And I don't care if the world explodes
(world ex-plodes)
No, I don't care if the world explodes.
(ex-plodes)
You can save the whales, you can save the toads
(Toads)
But I don't care if the world explodes!

Boom! Pow! 
Boom! Pow! 
Boom! Pow!
Boom! Pow!

Sanity never came my way
(came his way)
sanity never came my way
(his way)
I don't know what I'll do today
(way)
'Cause sanity never came my way

Lost my mind just a couple of times
(lost his mind)
lost my mind just a couple of times
(his mind)
you can spend your nickels, you can spend your dimes
(mind)
but I lost my mind...

Well, I saw it again
(I saw it again)
A form in my window
(in my window)
It wants to come in
(it wants to come in)
Well, I seen it before
(I seen it before)

When I wake up in the night
(I'm pulled from my dreams)
Well, when something's not right
I try not to look
(but the curtains pull open its breathing I hear)
For there is the shape
That I fear
And I'm fully woken
I saw it again

I saw it again
I saw it again
I saw it again
I saw it again

I get rejected, when you move about and you lose me
Tongue tied, I can hardly get myself to
Say Something
Gotta say it in morse code, gotta say it on the radio
Say Something
I gotta get loose

Im finding nothing, when I cruise the other side
Then I find you jumping out on the alley cat sidewalk so high
My, you fall so gracefully, just gaze my way and
Say Something
Gotta say it in Morse code, gotta say it on the radio
Say Something, and we can finally get loose sometime

Take it on high You can testify

Just when you get a little impulse to almost
Start vibration in the inside of your throat
Someone has to make an interruption
They tap into a hydrant, spray us with the hose

Lets talk about the time through dirty little streets we can roam
Park in every cul de sac and hide so we never get home
Talk is cheap anyway, words can get overblown
Let the transmission do its thing and we can swing in the drone

Say Something Say it in smoke signals
Say it in Morse code, Slur it so the words erode
Say Something Move it in charades
But baby theres no need to stay clammed up today
In your fifteen minutes of fame, with all the network cameras aimed
Could you just one time come up with a line that expresses everything that you wanted to
Say Something

Kitty Malone sat on a mule
Was riding in style
When suddenly, like the sound of a buzzard's breaking
Kitty felt laser beams being fired at her head
She said, "I hate laser beams
And you never done see me askin'
For a UFO
In Tomahawk County"

Well she kicked the mule
And it walked the path
And the aliens fired from behind
Till she stopped the mule
And she kicked the rump
And the big old mule took a big old dump

Scent of a mule, you better watch out where you go
Take your laser beams away
Scent of a mule, you better watch out where you go
You better stop that laser game
Or you'll smell my mule

She felt the fire against her neck
And it saddened her to feel it burn
When suddenly, like the sound of a breeding Holstein
Kitty said, "Stop, we ain't lookin' for fightin'
In Tomahawk County."

A little guy from the UFO
Came on out and said his name was Joe
She said, "Come on over for some lemonade
Just follow me now with the whole brigade"

Scent of a mule, you better watch out where you go
Take your laser beams away
Scent of a mule, you better watch out where you go
You better stop that laser game

They walked into her cabin shack
They had never seen a southern home
And they liked it, better than their UFO
They liked it, they really liked it
They said, "Here's a place of elegance
Here we shower ourselves in lightness"

Scent of a mule, you better watch out where you go
Take your laser beams away
Scent of a mule, you better watch out where you go
You better stop that laser game


If you would stop and notice that we number every day
But allow the many moments left uncounted slip away

You dont have to count them, just enjoy them one by one
Then things would take a different hue and sparkle in the sun
The winds would lift you up into the sky

The winds would lift you up into the sky above
Where you would see a trail of treasured memories you love 
A rainbow record of the thoughts and moments you've enjoyed
Arcs behind the earth as spectral colors in the void

In the void
Scents and subtle sounds

If you would only start to live
One moment at a time
You would, I think, be startled
By the things that you would find

Like scents you never noticed
And many subtle sounds
Like colors in the landscape
And textures of the town

Then the winds would lift you up
Into the sky above
An you'd be treated to a view
Of everything you love
And if the moment passes
You should try it once again
For if you do it right
You'll find the moment never ends

Sometimes when the evening's young
The wind dies down, the setting sun 
Crochets the clouds with yarn so fine
And fills the oceans with red wine

The trees, the sky, the forest fair
Bring a flavor to the air
I raise my glass and in a while 
You answer with a secret smile

Hold on, hold on to me 

An airborne leaf that landed near 
Has carried Dionysus here
Hell slip away but only when 
He sees our glasses filled again

Setting sail
I hit a whale
and my ship sank
right away
Losing face
I left this place
Because I hated sailing anyway

Blue, splinter and grow
New crystals of snow
Seen several kinds
Through seven below

The terrible thing about hell
Is that when you're there you can't even tell
As you move throught this life you love so
You could be there and not even know

But you say so what I'm doing just fine
The irony is that is't all in your mind
And that is why hell is so vicious and cruel
But you'll just go on an oblivious fool

Its no easy road
this struggle and strife
We find ourselves in the show of life
Whats on the schedule
Whats on your plan
Do you ever ignore
What you dont understand

Dont ask me cause I dont know
I just fasten my seat belt wherever I go

Its been perfectly planned
its completely insane
its a revolving cast
but its the same old game

Waves of people
They come and they go
Shine for a while
Its a marvelous show

its a limited time that we exist
We slowly make our way into the mist

My thoughts are racing
I see faces of the friends that I recall
Id like to take this time to thank you all

Just as the blind imagine
what it is to have sight
We slowly take a stroll into the night

Its no easy road
This struggle and strife
We find ourselves in the show of life

In the show of life
In the show of life
(Find myself right here)

In the show of life
(Find ourselves right here)
In the show of life
(Find ourselves right here)
In the show of life
(Find ourselves right here)

My glance is always darting, when I stroll the avenue
Avoiding all the obstacles that terrorize my view
If you are here with me, I trust you to lead the way
When you're not I follow you, and always go astray

Silent in the morning
Suspended in the trees
Lunch time comes you've found your voice
It brings me to my knees
The volume just increases
The resounding echoes grow
Till once again I bask in morning stillness, I love so

The target that I shoot for seems to move with every breath
I tighten all my arteries and make one last request
Divine creation hears me, and he squashes me with fear
I think that this exact thing happened to me, just last year

Silent in the morning
You found your voice that brings me to
Silent in the morning
You found your voice that brings me to
Silent in the morning
You found your voice that brings me to my knees
I will not dismiss you, shelter you, speak with you
Smile at you, trust in me, He'd like to brush you off, and I'd agree


We've got it simple
Cause we've got a band
And we've got cymbals in the band
We've got it simple
Cause we've got a band
And we've got cymbals in the band

What is a band without cymbals?
Ooh ooh, cymbals are grand

We've got a saxophone
Cause we've got a band
And we've got a saxophone in the band
We've got a saxophone
Cause we've got a band
And we've got saxophone in the band

What is a band without saxophone?
Ooh ooh, saxophone is grand

Cymbals and saxophones
Saxophones and cymbals
Cymbals and saxophones
Saxophones and cymbals

We've got Bebop
Cause we've got a band
And we play Bebop in the band

We've got skyscraper
And it sings a pretty tune
'Cuz every band needs skyscraper too

What is a band without skyscraper?
Ooh ooh skyscraper is grand!

Sim-Bop & Be-Bophone
Sky-Balls & Sax-Scraper

and light my day, you fired me
But then you stole the sun, delighted me
Now the day is gone, you knighted me 

It's dawning on me how it starts
Your wisdom must be why it smarts
Some wholes sum as many parts
Sing Sing Monica Sing your song 
it really didn't last too long

Sing Sing Monica sing your song
can you admit that you were wrong?
go back home where you belong
Sing Monica, Sing Monica...

You gave me one last taste, retreated me
Then cut me off at the knees, defeated me
From your ivory tower, inspired me
Then stole my manhood, desired me

It's setting in now how it ends
you may have one it all depends
have-nots have as many friends
Sing Sing Monica Sing your song 

it really didn't last too long
Sing Sing Monica sing your song
can you admit that you were wrong?
go back home where you belong

Sadly she set me free...

you charged me up, excited me
upended and re-righted me
you hooked me up, you wired me
but when my tread was worn, retired me

I'm saying all this stuff because
it's finally dawning on me how it was

Sing Monica, Sing Monica...

Slave to the traffic light
Slave
See the city, see the zoo
Traffic light won't let me through

I can't describe the feeling when
I'm in my bed asleep and then
I wake up with a vision blurred
and all my efforts are deterred
to reconstruct this image lost

there're certain things my mind won't do
and even though they're very few
the image glistens like a gem
repairing is not one of them

so I'm awake though in my mind
the image that so unrefined
is calling to me from the deep
tempting me to fall asleep

Slow slow, my brother
You will sleep again
Long long, when it passes
You will breathe again
Snow falls...
and it passes

Time time, in good time
You will live again
Hold on, when it passes
You will be again

Long long, on and on
Carefree and downstream
You will live again
You will live again
You will live again

All you'll be, and all that's gone
Is leading you on and on, on and on...
You will live again
You will live again

Slow slow, my brother
You will sleep again
Long long, when it passes
You will breathe again
Snow falls...
and it passes

You will sleep again
You will sleep again
You will sleep again

All you'll be, and all that's gone
Is leading you on and on, on and on...
All you'll be, and all that's gone
Is leading you on and on, on and on...

You will sleep again
You will sleep again
You will sleep again
You will sleep again
You will sleep again

The feeling's not the same
In fact it's getting pretty tame
It's just not that great anymore

I guess I'll go outside
And flag a weasel for a ride
And take it on down to the shore

Wallowing in fear
The days and weeks that you're not here
Was all the waiting in vain?

The day that you arrived
My sleeping monkey is revived
But you sent him home on the train

Home on the train
Why'd you send my monkey on a train?
The day that you arrived
My sleeping monkey is revived
But you sent him home on the train

Home on the train


Blind me in bright sheets of snow
Over fields so calm your swirling echoes slow
Winds freeze your lost voice
Frosts into white noise
Melt me; a sunbelt warms the snow
My thoughts all slow and sink in mud below

The pressure builds, you buy a gift
You're hoping that your dread will lift
It glitters on her like a glass
You shudder as it comes to pass
Apologize to Luce and Lil'
Converse with Ed, a drive with Jill
Your friends confine you in their worlds
One by one, a string of pearls
Confuse you say, this isn't me
You hover in their unity
Ashamed, you slowly lose your grasp
Release the links, undo the clasp
The skin that drips down from the tree
And peels back slowly from your knee
Erupts into your lung and heart
You laugh and laughing, fall apart
Laugh and laughing, fall apart

Odors in the evening mist
spices that you can't resist
Curl around and resound
through caverns that the breeze has kissed

Drawn inside, you hear a tone
as each foot hits a stepping stone
The music soothes and calms your mood
but suddenly you're not alone

A single cloud within a storm
descends and leaves behind a form
Someone that you knew appears in front of you
A woman's figure, rain-cloud-born 

She blinks but doesn't see you yet
she shivers and is soaking wet
You cross the sand and take her hand
a lifetime passed since last you met

Centuries now fall away
handed down since yesterday
When you were young and in the sun
you let your woman slip away

You take the hands that you have missed
and kiss the lips you haven't kissed 
for many years 
taste the tears

Spices that you can't resist

Found the beauty of small things
in this time, running free
turned off notices
feet are back on the ground
in this time, came around

Ladders rising up and through these 
splinters of hail
these blocks I built
are keeping me from letting go

Pick up one
see it
put it aside
Turn around, around

Found the beauty of small things
splinters of hail
(splinters of hail)

Turn around
splinters of hail
(splinters of hail)

In the morning I pack up my gear
and toss it in my carryall
Run the wide load to the lip
and watch the big core crack and glow

In the evening I undo my belt
Split open and melt

I wake up on my stomach
with my face between my hands
and crawl along the floor toward the doorway
Jumping to my feet
I try to put myself together
but I feel it in my knees
and the room begins to spin
and I slip and bump my head and raise a welt
Split open and melt

We breathe deep
in a steam dream
and plunge below the water line
down, down, down
between beams
to the gloom room
among the seaweed and the slime
down, down, down
Melt

You can't lie
You can't lie to yourself, very long
You can't lie
You can't lie to yourself, very long

The plane
You didn't pay me for the plane on time
The plane
You didn't pay me for the plane on time

You can't hide
You can't hide from yourself, not at all
You can't hide
You can't hide from yourself, not at all

The plane
You didn't pay me for the plane on time
The plane
You didn't pay me for the plane on time

I don't know how I'll die, but it won't be money
The plane
The plane
Plane on time

I was standing on the runway
I was running to the standby
I'll never understand why
Stood by the stand guy
A-waitin' for the standby

I was standing on the runway
(He was asking for it anyway)
Running to the standby
I'll never understand why
Stood by the stand by
A-waitin' for the stand guy

You can't hide
You can't lie
You can't lie
You can't hide

So go ahead and try to be
Gimme a ticket defy to be 
Nobody said to cover me with tartar
Go outside and visit the ground
Imagine demanded to smash in the mouth
About to smash in the mouth

The plane
You didn't pay me for the plane on time
The plane
You didn't pay me for the plane on time

If you feel your love might quit
you only need a tiny bit
of two things I can help you see
togetherness and unity

Take a tiny measure of them
to restore your flag in love
and if it still is running down
don't concentrate and

Spread It 'Round

Never cast it carelessly
and save a tiny bit for me
because I know there's much to spare
and people need it everywhere

together we are all alone united
on a spinning stone
so if your love is running down
don't concentrate and

Spread It 'Round
Spread It 'Round
Spread It 'Round

so if it's love that you have found
don't ever trade it

Spread It 'Round
Spread It 'Round
Spread It 'Round
Spread It 'Round
and round and round

Pulling the pavement from under my nails
I brush past a garden, dependent on whales
The sloping companion I cast down the ash
Yanked on my tunic and dangled my stash

Zipping through the forest with the curdling fleas
To grow with them spindles, the mutant I seize
I capture the dread beast who falls to his knees
And cries to his cohorts, asleep in the trees

Smegma, dogmatagram, fishmarket stew
Police in a corner, gunnin' for you
Appletoast, bedheated, furblanket rat
Laugh when they shoot you, say
"Please don't do that"

Control for smilers can't be bought
The solar garlic starts to rot
Was it for this my life I sought?
Maybe so and maybe not

Got a blank space where my mind should be
Got a Clif Bar and some cold green tea
Got clouds that seem to follow me
Got strange demands piled up on me
Got memories
Memories of being free

Gonna steal time from the faulty plan
Gonna act as though Im still a man
Gonna give you one last chance to see
Gonna shrug demands off of me
Gonna dream
Dream of being free

Gonna steal time from the faulty plan
Got a blank space where my mind should be

there is the tower 
like a solitary flower 
standing in the snow 
as the wolves all wait below 
and you're walking on the ledge 
throwing bread crusts off the edge 
as you sing in voice so clear 
and my name I think I hear 
concealed within the theme 
then it disappears as steam 

and I'm standing far below 
watching wolves you seem to know 
as your voice still carries on 
in your never-ending song 
and my blood begins to boil 
and my bones melt into oil 
hissing liquid in the snow 
as my body sinks below 
and a ripple sends a beam 
of sunlight dancing through the steam 

my now unfettered soul 
has direction I control 
to your tower I draw near 
but do I see a trace of fear? 
the approaching sound of hooves 
now scatters all the wolves 
you briefly watch the horseman ride 
then you quickly run inside 
the rider's weapons gleam 
while the horse's nostrils steam 

there's no time to reflect, who 
is this man? I must protect you 
in the rider's hand I see 
he holds your prison's only key 
he glances up and glares 
and then he starts to climb the stairs 
I can tell you're terrified 
so I quickly go inside 
but then I hear a fateful scream 
and your soul joins mine as steam 

we escaped the dreadful night 
and as lovers soared in flight 
blissful weeks turned into seasons 
but one day without a reason 
or goodbye you flew below 
back to the animals you know 
now you forever sing your song 
with the wolves where you belong 
now quite alone I often dream 
I hear you singing through the steam

Much ado is all I see
in fact it is surrounding me
the seething crowd intrudes all day
'til finally I'm swept away

although I thought my roots were deep
I sank them into hillsides steep
and riverbanks that soon erode
near canyons that have overflowed

I'm needing less restraint before 
I'm needing to hit the lights and close the door 
I'm fine, I'm fine cause I'm... 

(Chorus)
Dripping in this strange design 
None is yours and far less mine 
Hold the wheel, read the sign 
Keep the tires off the line 
Just relax, you're doing fine 
Swimming in this real thing I call life 
Can I bring a few companions on this ride? 

I'm feeling, my heart's not beating anymore 
I'm feeling. it's alright, this happened once before 
I'm fine, I'm fine cause I'm... 

(chorus 2x)

Standing on the edge of a cliff
I start to slip
Dont mind if I slide off
Now I feel my mood start to lift
I find my grip
And the screaming fades away below

I grab myself and spin me around
I start to sprint
I climb down to steadier ground
If I could bushwhack it on back to the shack
Behind those hills
Ill find the world is finally still

Run through pale dark woods
To that sugar shack
Breathe warm steam and hide
In that old sugar shack

Boiling heat
Maple steam
Frozen snow
Then it flows
When you leave 
Your maple dream
Wait til spring
To go again

A mosaic of lies 
I tried to arrange
In ways that shelter the blame
I thought I might have made off clear
With all of the loot
I plucked and ate all the fruit

Then I started hearing the yells
And shattering plates
Drowned out by your slithering stares
I was followed and chased
And caught and tied up by the hate
Right until I made my escape

We danced all night
And swam at dawn
In the summer of '89
And lives stretched out
Like a rolling ball
In the summer of '89

I see you standing there
In that dress you used to wear
You stole my heart
But I didn't mind
In the summer of '89

Brazilian music on the stereo
We hiked the long trail to a spring
I took blades of grass
And I wove you a ring

Our eyes were bright
But our smiles were worn
In the summer of '95
On the road
When our first was born
In the summer of '95

We'd sing to put her down
As the bus rolled out of town
We were driving blind
No clue where we'd arrive
In the summer of '95

Life changes, time presses on
It seems each year goes faster than the last
No, it's not that I don't like the way things are
But lately time just drives me right back to the past

Glad to find any time alone
And it's summer once again
The days are whole
But they're not our own
Remember our life back then.

We shared one small room
And a bed and a chair
I close my eyes
You touch my hand
You smile
And I'm there

You're the same girl I loved back then
For now and all time
You'll be that girl of mine
In the summer of '89

And we danced all night
And we danced all night

Little Suzy Greenberg, with her head caved in
Soon to let me drown beneath the undertow
You better put that woman in a looney bin
'Cause you know I'd really like to be a part of her show

Suzy is an artist, she paints quite a lot
An artist she may be, but a genius she is not
She says she wants to be a sociologist
But she better first get checked by a neurologist

Suzy, Suzy, Suzy, Suzy
Suzy, Suzy Greenberg
Suzy, Suzy, Suzy, Suzy
Suzy, Suzy Greenberg

Suzy's 'bout as faithful as a slot machine
Pays off once in a while, but then she robs you clean
She's always afraid that she's not sure what she's worth
She's out of her mind, and she's not of this Earth

The woman walks the streets like she's the queen of the town
Doesn't talk very much, she's very profound
Little Suzy Greenberg, always playing a game
But today I bet she's probably forgot my name!

Suzy, Suzy, Suzy, Suzy
Suzy, Suzy Greenberg
Suzy, Suzy, Suzy, Suzy
Suzy, Suzy Greenberg

Little Suzy Greenberg, with her head caved in
Soon to let me drown beneath the undertow
You better put that woman in a looney bin
'Cause you know I'd really like to be a part of her show

An artist she may be, but a genius she is not
She says she wants to be a sociologist

Much ado is all I see
and I feel like its surrounding me
the crowd intrudes all day
'til Im finally swept away

I can't talk my talk with you
Nothing's ever soaking through
The filter that surrounds your thoughts
And holds out lessons left untaught

I can't talk my talk with you
Nothing's ever soaking through
The filter that surrounds your thoughts
And holds out lessons left untaught
I can't talk my talk with you

I can't sing my song with you
Nothing's ever soaking through
The filter that surrounds your thoughts
And holds out lessons left untaught

I can't sing my song with you
Nothing's ever soaking through
The filter that surrounds your thoughts
And holds out lessons left untaught
I can't sing my song with you

I can't talk my talk with you

I'm up and I can take what you give
And I'm here but I don't want you to live with me
'Cause all I want is a taste for free

I'm down and I will drag you along and around
Until you burst into song and unwind
And leave your new life behind for a while

Cause I can see through the lines
Cause I can see through the lines

I'm down and I will drag you along and around
Until you burst into song and unwind
And leave your new life behind for a while

I'm out and I will stay here alone and without
Someone controlled by the phone and TV
'Cause what it's doing to me is fine

Cause I can see through the lines
Cause I can see through the lines

Oooh oooh
Step into space
Oooh oooh
Alter my place
Oooh oooh
That someone else made
Why I have stayed
Into things I could be
Or if I could see
Into fog that surrounds
And pins me to the ground

I can see through the lines
I can see through the lines
I can see through the lines
I can see through the lines

The sky is burning in this lonely land
And i kneel by the river and i feel the sand and the wind
The wind from beyond the mountain
The wind from beyond the mountain
And she comes to me in this lonely land
And looks down from the multi-beast on which she rides like the wind
The wind from beyond the mountain
The wind from beyond the mountain

[The following verse appears in early versions of the song]

Tela was born in a vulgar crooked hut
In the shadow of Wilson's castle
Venomous scorn from a life of bitter toil
In the shadow of Wilson's castle
Glorious steam fueled by her hatred it grew
Swelling to the point where it would
Burst at the seems there was nothing she could do

Tela tela jewel of Wilson's foul domain
Tela tela jewel of Wilson's foul domain
A lullaby the breezes whisper

And I look into her eyes and my frozen heart begins to thaw
And burn, 'til layer after layer melts away into a pool
A sky blue mirror of her eyes
And my soul is made of marble but in her gaze I crumble into dust
And drift away on the wind
The wind from beyond the mountain
The wind from beyond the mountain

[The following verse appears in early versions of the song]

Tela grew strong from her struggle to endure
In the shadow of wilson's castle
Time touched her wounds and shelter proved the cure
In the shadow of wilson's castle
Each passing day seemed to feed the brazen serpent locked inside
And liberate the spirit she'd concealed for so long
There was no place left to hide

Tela tela jewel of Wilson's foul domain
Tela tela jewel of Wilson's foul domain
A lullaby the breezes whisper

Thesba called me on the phone
He had a case of colic
I told him it was 'cause he was
A rubbing alcoholic

Trempkin was so proud he was
Such a great romancer
Until I said the world could use
One less beer-bellied dancer

Nell-Catain was pregnant and 
She heard all the expressions
It's just a hot flash or
Or else those fire breathing lessons

I sleep, I dream, I dream I sleep
Sometimes dreaming is too deep
If I could shed one layer now
I'd still remain asleep somehow

When I see the connection
Though I see I dont stare
Though I see I dont stare

When Im lost in my reflection
Though I see I dont stare
Though I see I dont stare

Then I change my direction
One foot follows the other
One foot follows something new
Cause I need some protection
And Im scared I could lose it
If I stare, youll be gone

When I need some attention
Though I see I dont stare
Though I see I dont stare

When Im lost in my reflection
Though I see I dont stare
Though I see I dont stare

As he saw his life run away from him
Thousands ran along
Chanting words from a song

Please me, have no regrets
Please me, have no regrets

Came from the baby's mouth
We follow the lines going south

Please me, have no regrets

Came from the, came from the, came from the... baby's mouth!
We follow the lines going south!

As he saw his life run away from him
Thousands ran along
Chanting words from a song

Please me, have no regrets
Please me, have no regrets

Please me, have no regrets

Came from the, came from the, came from the... baby's mouth!
We follow the lines going south!

It's time I sling the baskets off this overburdened horse
Sink my toes into the ground and set a different course
Cause if I were here and you were there
I'd meet you in between
And not until my dying day, confess what I have seen

Passing through the corridor I came upon an aging knight
Who leaned against the wall in gnarly armor
He was on his way to see the king

Wilson
Wilson
Wilson

He led me through the streets of Prussia talking
As he tried to crush a bug that scurried underneath his boot heel
He said there was a place where we should go

So he lead me through the forest to the edge of a lagoon by which
We wandered 'til we reached a bubbly spring
The knight grew very quiet as we stood there
He lifted up his visor and he turned to me and he began to sing

He said I come from the land of darkness
I said I come from the land of doom
He said I come from the land of Gamehendge
From the land of the big baboon
But I'm never never going back there
And I couldn't if I tried
'Cause I come from the land of Lizards
And the Lizards they have died
And the Lizards they have died
And the Lizards they have died
And the Lizards they have...

He told me that the Lizards were a race of people practically extinct
From doing things smart people don't do
He said that he was once a Lizard, too
His name was Rutherford the Brave and he was on a quest to save
The people from the fate that lay before them
Their clumsy end was perilously near

The Lizards would be saved, he said, if they could be enlightened
By the writings of the Helping Friendly Book
In all of Prussia only one existed
And Wilson had declared that any person who possessed it was a crook

He said I come from the land of darkness
I said I come from the land of doom
He said I come from the land of Gamehendge
From the land of the big baboon
But I'm never never going back there
And I couldn't if I tried
'Cause I come from the land of Lizards
And the Lizards they have died
And the Lizards they have died
And the Lizards they have died
And the Lizards they have

The Helping Friendly Book, it seemed, possessed the ancient secrets
Of eternal joy and never-ending splendor
The trick was to surrender to the flow

We walked along beneath the moon
He lead us through the bush 'til soon
We saw before our eyes a raging river
He said that we could swim it if we tried

And saying this the knight dove in forgetting that his suit of arms
Would surely weigh him down and so he sunk
And as his body disappeared before me
I bowed my head in silence and remembered all thoughts that he had thunk

He said I come from the land of darkness
I said I come from the land of doom
He said I come from the land of Gamehendge
From the land of the big baboon
But I'm never never going back there
And I couldn't if I tried
'Cause I come from the land of Lizards
And the Lizards they have woah whoa whoa!

A day in the life of a waiter/addict with delusions of grandeur.

Spasm waiter dropping to his knees, sees
Slander on wrap paper ties
Lifting up his head he feels the sunlight in his eyes

Grasp a kettle top and shoot the breeze, please
Ramble while slop scraper sighs
Tossing in his bed at night he'll dream until he dies

Operations at the sink
The Dribble liquid visible beneath his troubled eyes
Feels it tilt and start to side

Mask a pretty hopper's foot with squeeze cheese
Dangle some grape apple pies
Tranquil and serene until he runs out of supplies

Your hands and feet are mangos
You're gonna be a genius anyway

All throughout I gaze and glimpse you
loving never did convince you
I see you when you're all alone
It's like a  person, I've not known

The moment ends though I feel winds
Blowing differently then ever before
And they're pushing me further from shore

The moment ends / though I feel winds (x8)
The moment ends / The moma dance (x8)

a frothy cap the steady slap
of lines against the rail
a biting rain take in the main

Up the rigging
taking sail 
mind the skipper 
we'll not fail
He'll bring out wine 
and we'll be fine 
just heed the order 
watch the sail

The moment ends / though I feel winds (x8)
The moment ends / The moma dance (x8)

They call me the sloth
(Way down in the ghetto)
Italian Spaghetti
(Singing falsetto)
Sleeping all day
(Rip Van Winklin')
Spend my nights in bars
(Glasses tinklin')

I'm so bad
(He's so nasty
Ain't got no friends
(Real out-casty)
Stay out of my way
(Or you'll end up a cripple)
I'll take this piece of paper
(And slice your nipple)

They call me the sloth

The Squirming Coil of sunset
I keep within my reach
Tried yesterday to get away
and hitchhiked to the beach

I saw Satan on the beach
trying to catch a ray
He wasn't quite the speed of light
and the squirming coil
it got away....

The muscles flex the mother's ring
She fastens children to her king
and sends him down the crooked street
When he returns, the birth's complete

Jimmy holds the Tannis root
The forest's tasty nectar shoot
The sun tips off the monarch's suit
from sequined sash to shiny boot

"I'd like to lick the coil some day
Like Icarus, who had to pay
with melting wax and feathers brown
He tasted it on his way down"

Stun the puppy!
Burn the whale!
Bark a scruff and go to jail!
Forge the coin and lick the stamp!
Little Jimmy's off to camp

Were bobbing on the surface 
and the shadow glides below 
They say she feels my heartbeat 
Oh, But how Ill never know

That its the ocean flowing in our veins
 That its the salt thats in our tears 
Cause we could have come so very far
 In at least as many years!

Take the highway through the Great Divide

Im building you a pyramid 
With limestone blocks so large 
I drag them from the mountain top 
Youll need a two car garage

And its the ocean flowing in our veins 
That its the salt thats in our tears 
'Cause we could have come so very far 
In at least as many years

Take the highway through the Great Divide

'Cause its the ocean flowing in our veins 
That its the salt thats in our tears 
'Cause we could have come so very far 
In at least as many years

Take the highway through the Great Divide

I feed from the bottom you feed from the top
I live upon morsels you happen to drop
and coffee that somehow leaks out of your cup
If nothing comes down then I'm forced to swim up

On the way upwards the colors come back,
but all on the bottom is blue, gray and black,
the darkness is cold and perception goes wrong
and the night seems to go on incredibly long

pantomime mixtures of heaven and earth,    
jumbled events that have less than no worth
time in the forest to dig under rocks
float on the ocean and sleep in a box

or sink just below all the churning and froth
and swim to the light-source, or fly like a moth
so toss away stuff you won't need in the end
but keep what's important - and know who's your friend

so I ask you why
if I'm swimming by
don't you see anything that you'd like to try?

I need a new way to express myself
So you don't need to guess
What otherwise I'd say aloud
And watch it float just like a cloud

High up above you like a thunderhead
But you would just look down instead
And wait 'til foggy skies abate
And vapor clouds all dissipate

And when with them all my words for you
Have softly sublimated too
And you'll just hope that I've moved on
So you'll look up and find me gone

["Submarine"]

In and out of focus
Time turns elastic
In and out of focus
In and out of focus
Time turns elastic
In and out of focus
In and out of focus
Time turns...

And when I'd stayed too long
I went outside and stared
Arms outstretched and long
Moved straight across the sky
(In and out of focus)
(In and out of focus)

If I could wrap my arms around this globe
Hands, touch the green and brown
I'd sink into the cool, cool ground
(In and out of focus)
(In and out of focus)

Seen all, seen all, seen all summer
Seen all, seen all, seen all spring

But I'm a submarine
submarine sinks below
The ground
a submarine

I'm a submarine
submarine sinks below
The ground

["Landslide"]

Now that the leaves have turned to gold
The moments all glow
Frozen and free from time

And out here on my own
I watch it ebb and flow

Here, with the fire burning low
In the honey mist that breathes
Crooked maple fingers trembling all around
I feel the winds that blow

Out here between the dark and light
The summer's gone, and the reeds bow down
As the colors change
All along the water line

oooohhhhhh

And when it's time the landslide will free what froze inside
While all around the rocks collide
You finally see the lines
That point toward the light that never dies

Melody, shelter in the darkness
Take hold of me now
Memory, trapped in a corner
Dark fingers are long

But all around streaming down
Rays of blue light, calling out

["Silver Sound Shower"]

These silver sounds are raining down on me
Here on the wheel, the rhythms turning all around
Up above the darkened sky is bleeding
I feel the world turning upside down

["Funnels"]

These are the reasons that we lay down on the ground
Drawn through a funnel, all the colors run together
Turning brown

Wait for the waves to come and carry me away
Down on the ground the sounds of voices in the echoes seem to say

["Carousel"]

And as the carousel circles unceasingly
Watch while the ripples decay in this rolling time
And cascading, the winds set the wheels in motion
And its turning in the mist around me
Rolling and turning into the mist around me

Kissed by the water and held in your mothers arms
Green where you tumble and roll in these fields
The shapes of the bodies that shift in the sun
While the blossoms all scream and it sleeps around me
The earth in these memories heals around me

In and out of focus, time turns elastic
time turns
In and out of focus, time turns elastic
time turns

Touches these woods and these waters all paved with gold
Gleaming in daylight the voices ring on
They pull while the pointing lay down in the storm
And this life is bending and swelling around me

Rolling and turning into the mist around me
The winds all rising in the west around me
And the carousel turns into breath around me

In and out of focus, time turns elastic
time turns
In and out of focus, time turns elastic
time turns
In and out of focus, time turns elastic
time turns
In and out of focus, time turns elastic
time turns

Today I sing tomorrow's song
In this place we learn to wait

All the way home we felt we had a chance
To review the coulds before we were born
And to invite a new game of cants
Absorbed in the clouds, a voice from afar said,
With the right device you can make a pattern grow
or you can tune up your car

So we stayed on the train admiring the time
As the lights of the city drew near
We drank a little wine
They were blurry and green, outer space in between,
With a depth and a form unclear
Then we saw it up ahead

A flickering lantern lit up on the tracks
In the rugs that had covered up the bridge
From the banks of a river 
to the bed of a valley upstream
to the place where you live

The glass from the lantern cast back the sight
of a drive-in movie we drove by below
We saw where wed been in the pictures within,
Projecting all the places we would go

So we followed the scene and flowed up your steps
To a smooth wooden floor in a trance
The train whistle melody wove through the trees
and in through the door to signal the turns of a dance

An asteroid crashed and nothing burned
it made me wonder:
Do tigers sleep in lily patches? 
Do rhinos run for thunder?

I got an ache in my left ear
I felt a twinge but I still could hear
Made me think I would not be burned
but rather give myself to science
I felt that I could help
To science, I felt that I can help

Paranoid the doctor ran
shouting his graphic translation
A fortnight of turmoil
gang wars and ails of riches
Spewing forth their color
he purposely waited till I was done
to knock on the lavatory door 
accusing me of ruining the fun
he knocked on it some more
The fun, He knocked on it some more

Alloyed suitors drawn inside
an apple or a grape
To put forth a cloud of mercury 
he was run over by a car
on a freeway in Los Angeles 
once the spraying has been done
'Cause there's more pain from necessity
you're a portrait of your past
There's a mummy in the cabinet
Are there no more arrows left?

What's that rubber bottle doing here? 
How's that napkin for a proof?
Ten cents to a dollar now 
for a shelf of pregnant eggs
Robert Palmer is implored to dance, to dance, to dance

It's so stupendous, living in this tube!

Won't you step into the freezer
Seize her with a tweezer

Won't you step into the freezer
Tease her with a tweezer

It's gonna be cold cold cold cold cold

Won't you step into the freezer
Please her with a tweezer

Won't you step into the freezer
Please her with a tweezer

It's gonna be cold cold cold cold cold

Look who's in the freezer
Uncle Ebenezer

Won't you step into the freezer?
Won't you step into the freezer?
Won't you step into the freezer?
Won't you step into the freezer?

I can hold my breath for a minute or so
Five days without food is as long as Ill go
I didnt sleep once for four days and three nights
I once didnt stop for seven red lights
I jumped into water thats fifty degrees
I rowed in a kayak in thirty-foot seas
I stayed in the woods for a week with a knife
A flint when I lost it nearly cost me my life
Twenty years later
Im still upside down

Its a small world
And its turning real fast
(Here upside down)
Its a new day 
And the mourning has passed
(Turned upside down)
Its a short road
But the mountains are tall
(Land upside down)
Its a small world
But we all start out small

I hurtle through air though I feel Im alone
I stick with the others to the skin of the stone
I stop for a stranger just to give him a lift
I cling like a lizard to the side of the cliff
I treat every minute like an hour and then
It seems like a year has just flashed by again
We build a foundation but where do we stand
When all air is water and all water is land

Twenty years later
Im still upside down

Its a small world
And its turning real fast
(Here upside down)
Its a new day 
And the mourning has passed
(Turned upside down)
Its a short road
But the mountains are tall
(Land upside down)
Its a small world
But we all start out small

Feel it turning in circles
And youre never the same again
Spin slowly while sounds cascade 
And became
Im here upside down

Inside this silent scene
All are free, all are free
Second time around

I spoke your name for many days
pronouncing it in several ways
and moving letters all around

and when you heard the end result
I told you it was not my fault
if you were here more of the day
it wouldn't twist around that way

Ten mountains stand tall
Nine seasons since fall
Eight eons of sand
Seven oceans began
Now there is none
No more light from the sun
Now waters run free
No more fish in the sea

One more name on the slate 
One less minute to wait
Too busy to see two versions of me
One more bottle is dry 
One less reason to try

Six feet underneath
Five fingers dont reach
Four seconds it seems for all of our dreams
Three oceans away
Two children at play
Too busy to see two versions of me

Undecided, undefined 
Undisturbed yet undermined
Relocated not retired
Reprimanded and rewired
Mystified and misshapen
Misinformed but not mistaken
Reinvented, redefined
Rearranged but not refined
Unrelenting, understroked
Undeterred yet unprovoked
Reinvented, redefined
Rearranged but not refined 
Mystified and misshapen
Misinformed but not mistaken
Undecided, undefined

Blind me with ambition 
like a razor to the throat
Cast aside your foolish pride 
I'll cast the final vote
The feelings you've been waiting for 
are clawing through your skin
And if you look above 
you'll see the vultures moving in

Timing is everything 
that much I know
Sometimes I'm faster 
and sometimes I'm slow
Some days I'm patient 
but sometimes I'm told
To go to the end of the line
But when I can't be
what's expected of me
I look at the clock 
and say "this can't be"
Watching it pass 
without reason or rhyme
I find myself drifting in time

I see the vultures moving in
I find myself drifting in time

Paulatek reminds me of The Bible
Andromeda was used, I think, before
My guess is that I'll never name this ghost well
But I think I hear him knocking at my door
(repeat)

Blind me with ambition
like a razor to the throat
Cast aside your foolish pride 
I'll cast the final vote
The feelings you've been waiting for 
are clawing through your skin
But if you look above 
you'll see the vultures moving in

I took a moment from my day
Wrapped it up in things you say
Mailed it off to your address
You'll get it pretty soon soon unless

The packaging begins to break
and all the points I tried to make
are tossed like thoughts into a bin
as time leaks out, my life leaks in

You wont find moments in a box
and someone else will set your clocks
I took a moment from my day
and wrapped it up in things you say
And mailed it off to you

I've been wading in the velvet sea
I've been wading in the velvet sea
I've been wading in the velvet sea
I've been wading in the, I've been wading in the...
I've been wading in the velvet sea

Waiting all night
Waiting all night
Mind is racing and I'm wondering what I did wrong
Waiting all night
Waiting all night

Where could you be
I'm so alone
Won't you please come home

Sun's coming up 
and I'm rolling over
But I'm holding on

Waiting all night
And I said I'm sorry
Waiting all night
But you went so far away
Waiting all night
Dont know why you
Waiting all night 
Left me this way
Waiting all night
Just sail on, sail on

Waking up
Scattered lace
Cigarette
From your face
Time to go
You won't leave
I don't know
What to believe

For I've been fooled by images
That swirl around me like you do
Of all the dreams I've ever had
Why would you come true
Why would you come true

I'm leaving you a message
I'm leaving you a trace
I'm leaving thoughts for you
I hope that time will not erase
And when the moment comes 
to read the words that I engrave
You'll find them on the walls of the cave

I know you heard the question
but you didn't make a sound
And when it fell you caught my heart
before it hit the ground
But if you ever need the names 
of those you couldn't save
You'll find them on the walls of the cave

Look at me
The time stands still
The mountain here is now a hill
Look away
The time goes past
These rocks will fall away at last

Maybe you will see it
as you're passing by alone
Below the moss forgotten
where some words adorn a stone
It might have been an etching
on a marker of a grave
Or maybe on the walls of the cave

Listen to
The silent trees
But still your words 
float on the breeze
Look away
I see them all
Carved into the cavern wall

don't want to be an actor, pretending on the stage
don't want to be a writer with my thought out on the page
don't want to be a painter 'cause everyone comes to look
don't want to be anything where my life's an open book

don't want to be a farmer, working in the sun
don't want to be an outlaw, always on the run
don't want to be a climber, reaching for the top
don't want to be anything where I don't know when to stop

a dream it's true
but I'd see it through
if I could be
wasting my time with you

so if I'm inside your head
don't believe what you might have read
you'll see what I might have said
to hear it
come waste your time with me

Listen as she speaks to you
hear the voices flutter through
the barriers arranged by you

Close the shutters draw the shades
Filter out the everglades
Glistening with evening dew

Thunder calls through waterfalls
Rising tide and ocean walls
I can hear you when you sigh

Listen as she speaks to you
Hear the voices flutter through
watch them and let them lie

I can hear you when you sigh
Through the water in the sky

How is it I never see
The waves that bring her words to me
For though unseen they drift around
They catch my breath and knock me down

I feel them quickly swirling by
As they withdraw with my reply
And slip into the dark of night
As I attempt to stay upright

Instead I'm stranded on my knees
As words depart upon the breeze
That quickly drifts away from here
And possibly won't reach her ear

If we could see these many waves
That flow through clouds and sunken caves
She'd sense at least the words that sought her
On the wind and underwater

Trying to make a woman that you move
And Im sharing in a Weekapaug groove

I'd like to cut your head off so I could weigh it
What do you say?
Five pounds? six pounds? seven pounds?

I'd like to go to your house 
and gather all your razors 
and pick all the little prickly hairs 
so I can weigh them
What do you say?
Five pounds? six pounds? seven pounds?

I'd like to gather all your friends 
and smoosh them into a small swimming pool 
so I could weigh them
What do you say?
Five pounds? six pounds? seven pounds?

Why weigh on a sunny day?
So much to do so why oh why weigh?
On a sunny day, why oh why weigh?
Why weigh, why weigh?

I'd like to hear my options
so I could weigh them
What do you say?
Five pounds? six pounds? seven pounds?

Why weigh on a sunny day?
So much to do, so why oh why weigh? 
On a sunny day, why oh why weigh?
Why oh why oh why...

You float above the traffic in your pickup truck
You always find some magic when youre running out of luck
I thought you might be driving back to me
It seems I cant rely on what I see

Why does the moss look electric green
Why is your whisper like an infinite scream
I know that things arent always what they seem

I caught you mixing potions in your yard
You might have times before but I wasnt looking hard
Now Im lost in the haze in clouds of rising steam
I fall on the moss and hear you laughing at me

Why does the moss look electric green
Why is your whisper like an infinite scream
I know that things arent always what they seem

Confronting you I had to hear the truth
I confessed my suspicions like a sinner in a booth
You ask if I was sure of what Id seen
You turn and walk off on the mossy green

Why does the moss look electric green
Why is your whisper like an infinite scream
I know that things arent always what they seem

(I might want you back with me)

Oh out near Stonehenge, I lived alone
Oh out near Gamehendge, I chafed a bone
Wilson, King of Prussia, I lay this hate on you
Wilson, Duke of Lizards
I beg it all trune for you

Talk my duke a mountain, Helping Friendly Book
Inasfar as fiefdom, I think you bad crook
Wilson, King of Prussia, I lay this hate on you
Wilson, Duke of Lizards
I beg it all trune for you

I talked to Mike Christian, Rog and Pete the same
When we had that meeting, over down near Game(hendge)
Wilson, King of Prussia, I lay this hate on you
Wilson, Duke of Lizards
I beg it all trune for you

You got me back thinkin' that you're the worst one
I must inquire, Wilson
Can you still have fun?
Wilson
Can you still have fun?
Wilson
Can you still have fun?
Wilson

Is that a wind, or a bug?
Is a windora bug

We've got the rules down now (Is that a wind, or a bug?)
and we're done learning how to speak (Is that a wind, or a bug?)
We're on the top of a cliff (Is that a wind, or a bug?)
and we're wondering if we should leap

In the basement once again
its to the depths I only find below
Looking up the basement window
catching all the shadows and the snow
hoping that this windy city 
keeps debris from blanketing my show

The stations there upon the chair
I watch his boxes turn from grey to green
the sound of sirens disappears 
as I turn down the sound on my TV
if you got a question 
please direct it to the number on your screen

Hell comes to receive me now
signals retrieve me now
onto the screen right now
help me to see

In the car the engine starts
to charge imparts a feeling onto me
in my mind I think its time 
to let this thing unfold or let it be
hoping that this memory 
is more about the future I might see

Hell comes to receive me now
signals retrieve me now
onto the screen right now
help me to see

Steal away, lets steal a car
Youll never win a major only shooting par
Step outside, feel the sun
Its only you, be you, cause youre the only one

And it feels good cause it feels good
And it feels good
And it feels good cause it feels good
And it feels good

Nothing lasts, nothing stays
Caught in this procession of unchanging days
Whats new is old, whats old is gone
Youre pushed up to the edge, so put your wingsuit on

Put your wingsuit on
And it feels good cause it feels good
And it feels good

And gliding away, you fly where you choose
Theres nothing to say, and nothing to lose

Steal away, paint the sky
Put your wingsuit on

And gliding away, you fly where you choose
Theres nothing to say, and nothing to lose
Time to put your wingsuit on

the winter queen looks up and sighs:
I wish that I controlled the skies
for up above is where to stand
to rule those who walk on the land

the summer queen flies by and sees
her realm of butterflies and bees
and said, I wish I lived below
instead I sail where breezes blow 

and the rain came down
it tried to seep
into the ground
but water deep

pecked and poked
and sodden soil
already soaked
began to roil

the prince of silence walks below
inside a cave of ice and snow
he says "I wonder why?" but words
are locked in glaciers, never heard

the prince of music on guitar
neglects to play a single bar
but music trapped inside his head
resounds and fills the space instead

the winter queen looks up and sighs...

Well it was many years ago now
But I really can't be sure
That's when it all began then
I heard that knock upon my door

And the wolfman's brother
The wolfman's brother
Came down on me

Well, the telephone was ringing
That's when I handed it to Liz
She said, "This isn't who it would be,
If it wasn't who it is"

It's the wolfman's brother,
The wolfman's brother
Came down on me

So I might be on a side street
Or a stairway to the stars
I hear the high pitched cavitation
Of propellers from afar

It's the wolfman's brother...
Come down on me

So with meaningless excitement
And smooth atonal sound
It's like a cross between a hurricane
And a ship that's run aground

It's the wolfman's brother
Coming down on
coming down on me

Had to have that
Had to have that
Your wombat
Had that

Had to have that
Had to have that
Your wombat
Had that

You gotta take it with you when you're going forward
If you're moving on you've got to leave it behind
(Know you've got to leave it behind)

You gotta take it with you when you're going forward
If you're moving on you've got to leave it behind
(Know you've got to leave it behind)

Your wombat
You had that
Your wombat
You had that

You gotta take it with you when you're going forward
If you're moving on you've got to leave it behind
(Know you've got to leave it behind)

It's kinda like the theme from the "Fish" TV show
You know - with Abe Vigoda
The "Fish" TV show
You know - with Abe Vigoda

You gotta take it with you when you're going forward
If you're moving on you've got to leave it behind
(Bring it forward or leave it behind)

Little red wagon took a big jump
(Cuddly but deadly)
That pup was caught in a centrifuge
(Herbivorous, crepuscular)

Never did tumble over the side of the hill
(Discovered by a man named Wilson)
Kept flying down to Baton Rouge

Spit out the seeds
Gnaw on the pulp
Suck on the juice
And simmer the rinds
(Herbivorous, crepuscular)

Look at everything
You had to have
Bring it forward
(Bring it forward or leave it behind)
Or leave it behind

Cuddly, but muscular

Herbivorous, crepuscular
Cuddly, but muscular
Herbivorous, crepuscular
Cuddly, but muscular
Herbivorous, crepuscular
Cuddly, but muscular
Herbivorous, crepuscular

But I know youll be happy
That Im pouring concrete in the ground

Hoist up posts and beams erratically
Garden plots beautiful, Painter gets at it
But I guess I should have checked with you somehow

Thought I could get you to come to Yarmouth Road
Hang with the bees and buzz in the honeycomb
All I ever wanted you to do was to come on home
Hang with the bees and buzz in the honeycomb

I filled up the shelves with funny books to laugh to
Lazy susan has some of the mocha rings that you love
Registered our names so theyll know where to bring us our mail

Couldnt find flat wax for all the mahogany
Didnt we see some walking through a trade show
Does any of this even start to ring a bell

Thought I could get you to come to Yarmouth Road
Hang with the bees and buzz in the honeycomb
All I ever wanted you to do was to come on home
Hang with the bees and buzz in the honeycomb, when we need to roam

Blind faith stings hastily
My faith brings me, right to the flower shop
Id like that bouquet please, wrap some of those extra green things around the stems
A little card to write on if you have them

Candles are lit all the red napkins folded
Pecan pie wafting fumes from the oven
Turned off all the ringers on the phones

Look out the window see headlights passing by
Maybe I dont see you and I dont really know why
Dont make me feel like a guest in our own home

Boy
Man
God
Shit

Wash Uffizi drive me to Firenze

It's on the way, you never know

Tried to get away but they just kept comin'
Landed the jet with the limo runnin'
With a bird on my shoulder, they showed no pity
Left the cage at home and went to Mexico City

It's on the way, you never know
It's on the way, you never know

Stars and players, I knew them all
Crystal bottles lined the wall
Rob from Peter to pay for Paul
They watched me rise but didn't stick around to see me fall

And it's here, and it's now
And it's here, and it's now

Checking all those names right off your list
Until there was no one left to call
Money buys you friends, but friends money don't buy you much at all

Came so close, I had it all
It felt so good before the fall
I saw it come but I let it go
But I just met two guys with piles of cash in Mexico

You never know, you never know
You never know, you never know

Maybe that bird needed a cage (Needed a cage after all)
Maybe that bird needed a cage (Needed a cage after all)
Maybe that bird needed a cage (Needed a cage after all)
Maybe that bird needed a cage (Needed a cage after all)
